BOSTON -- A judge denied yesterday a request by a 94-year-old Everett woman to force the state Lottery Commission to pay her entire $5.6 million winnings to her upfront.

A ruling by Superior Court Justice Barbara A. Dortch-Okara allows the Lottery to go ahead with plans to pay Louise Outing in installments over 20 years.

''I expected that," Outing said. ''I'll make out some kind of way."

Outing, a retired waitress who won a Megabucks lottery drawing in September, said she won't live to collect her full winnings. She wants to take care of her seven grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren, and six great-great-grandchildren.

''I'd like to get it and do what I want with it," she said. ''I'm not going to live 20 years. I'll be 95 in March."

Joseph Sullivan, executive director of the Lottery, said the rules are printed on the back of Megabucks tickets. Only the multistate Mega Millions game offers a lump-sum option, he said.

''All Lottery players who win Megabucks prizes are held to the same rules and regulations as Ms. Outing, and these rules and regulations are reviewed with the winners when they claim their prizes," Sullivan said in a statement.

Outing's lawyer, James Dilday, said that the rules give Lottery officials discretion to authorize a lump-sum payment.

''They have the authority to do it; they just won't do it," Dilday said. ''They just don't care. They're telling this woman to go take a hike."

After an initial gross payment of $283,770, Outing would be paid 19 annual gross checks of $280,000. After taxes, it's $196,639 a year.
