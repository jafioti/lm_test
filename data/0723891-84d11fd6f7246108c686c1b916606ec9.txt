In this post I’m going to explain about how to copy other person’s IP addresses using a your own web site and the way of getting real personnel computer information such as internet service provider, type of services, what are the cookies, used web browsing software, computer language, his or her home place and country, the previous web site which is browsed, his or her operating system and the time of the computer.This is not a black-hat trick. Just an innocent trick to get the details. First you want to your own website for that. If yet you don’t have a website you can use blogger.com to create a web site. Otherwise you can use your own website for this purpose.Next go to this web siteand create your own account by filling fields called Email address, website and Password. Also select your timezone because data is stored in only one timezone. Then verify your account by entering your email.In your mail inbox you can see a java script. Copy that script and go to your website and add this script in to gadgets. That's it in terms of integrating script with your website. Once you have completed that step, go to the following URL.and login your just created account. After that send your website address to person which you want to get details. After confirming that person will enter your site then enter your account atand you can see the above mentioned information of your friend. Hope this trick works for you.
