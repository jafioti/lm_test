It's not often that this happens, but I will not be crediting another blog with breaking the news of the latest verbal commit. That's because I was actually the first one to break the news that 3-star DE Paulo Lepua went crimson. Look out Tom Luginbill, I comin' for your job soon.

Lepua currently has 10 offers, including five from Pac-12 schools. Scout lists him as a 6'3, 265 pound DE, but he played mostly inside at DT during his high school career. There are a few videos to check out, but I think his Hudl one is probably the best quality. You can view that here. Otherwise, check out his YouTube video below.







Like I said before, I think his Hudl page has the better of the two highlights, but you can still see what a presence he is. The guy wreaks havoc from the DT position, and is constantly in the backfield harassing the QB. He excels as a pass rusher, and perhaps that's why they project him as a DE in Mike Breske's 3-4. At 265 pounds, he's way too small to play NT, but about the right size to play DE. I'm sure he'll add some more weight/muscle once he enters WSU's conditioning program, and that can only help him.

Most pass rushers in high school have one move they rely on, be it the swim move, bull rush, spin move, etc. Lepua uses a combination of all of these to confuse the OL charged with blocking him. It's actually pretty impressive to see from a 17-year-old kid. In a perfect world, he'd add 20 or so pounds so he could slide inside on passing downs and give the Cougs a formidable pass rushing DT. Lepua is certainly impressive on film, and one of the better DTs we've signed in a while.

I love that we're adding big guys on the line, as we need all the help we can get up front. I'd like to see Mike Leach and Co. bring in a few more members of the secondary with these last few slots remaining, though.
