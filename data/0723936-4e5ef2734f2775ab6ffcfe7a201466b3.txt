Hello and welcome back to another update of Forgotten Hope 2.

This week we are showing off the older brother of the famous M1919 machine gun; the M1917A1 Browning machine gun!

The Browning M1917 was a belt-fed, water-cooled machine gun that saw combat use all the way through the 20th century. The original gun came to be known as the M1917 and first saw combat use at the tail end of World War I. After the war the weapon received various mechanical upgrades and changes, and was given the designation of M1917A1. Being a general purpose machine gun, it was used extensively by numerous countries throughout the Second World War. The large barrel jacket and additional water-cooling equipment meant that the 1917 was quite heavy, and was traditionally used as a static weapon for defense. The Browning M1917 was made by Seth Soldier and exported by Kev4000.

Up next we have three brand new in-game screenshots to show off. The first of which is the M1917 mounted on a jeep on the map Eppeldorf. The next two showcase the Breda 35 Italian AA gun mounted in the back of a Fiat truck, and the British Hawker Hardy in action on the recently announced map, Battle of Keren.





Our winner for this week's screenshot competition is Blodheafodban. You can view the winning submission here.
