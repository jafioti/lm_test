The Islanders are looking at Belmont Park in Elmont as a possible location to build a new arena, sources told Newsday's Robert Brodsky and Jim Baumbach.

A source told Newsday that the talks between the Islanders and the New York Racing Association, which runs Belmont Park, are in the early stages, but another source said the two sides have met a few times to discuss possibly bringing a hockey arena to the park.

According to the report, the Islanders are interested in a 28-acre portion of the park's south parking lot, which has been up for bid since 2012. Previous bidders include the New York Cosmos, which planned to build a 25,000-seat stadium.

In a report released by Bloomberg on Thursday, sources said the Islanders have considered a move to Queens near Citi Field.

In 2015-16, the Islanders played in Barclays Center for the first time, averaging 13,626 fans per game, which was an 11 percent decrease in attendance from the last season at Nassau Coliseum.

The big drawback of the Belmont site is the ambiguity that surrounds it. The site has been up for bid since 2012, but it still hasn't been awarded. Belmont officials are not giving any indication if a decision is imminent either.

That said, the fact that Belmont seems to be actively courting the Isles is very intriguing, and it would certainly be a better option than even Queens. A return to Nassau? The fan base would be delirious.

I have to say, as I read the tea leaves, I'm starting to get the sense that a move to either Queens or Belmont is more than just a bargaining position for the Isles. There's a lot more viability to this than initially met the eye.

I'm very intrigued to see where this heads, and with only three years left before the opt out rolls around, I have a feeling we'll get answers sooner than later.
