Elite cannabis genetics aren't shared with just anyone who asks for them. Growers pride themselves on holding certain rare strains close -- and dispensaries have been known to hoard them. For these reasons, you don't often see anyone freely distributing clones of hard-to-find strains. So it's surprising (and refreshing) to see a dispensary not only making a rare, medically beneficial strain available to the community, but to do so without charge.

Denver-based Greenwerkz medical marijuana dispensary has been touting R4, its CBD-rich strain, for years now, and with good reason. Unlike its cannabinoid counterpart THC, which is known for the "high" associated with marijuana, CBD has been found to alleviate pain with few to no mind-altering effects. While a high CBD amount for a normal strain would be up to 3 percent by weight, R4 has consistently clocked in at between 14 and 20 percent CBD. Not only that, but it also has ultra-low THC -- at times lower than 1 percent.

But getting the strain -- both in clone and seed form -- comes with stipulations: The genetics can't be resold (only gifted); any strains created using R4 have to be available to Greenwerkz; and, most notably, the finished buds can't be sold for more than $15 an eighth.
