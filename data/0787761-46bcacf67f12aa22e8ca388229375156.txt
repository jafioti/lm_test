The Tigers have designated outfielder Daniel Fields for assignment, Chris Iott of MLive.com reports. His 40-man spot will go to infielder Josh Wilson, who will be activated.

Fields, 24, reached the big leagues and recorded his first hit this year, but saw just one game of action. He’s spent most of his time at the Triple-A level over the past two seasons, slashing .225/.312/.358 in 825 plate appearances. Though not much of a power source, Fields has swiped 25 bags in that span.

Detroit drafted Fields in the sixth round back in 2009, drawing the high schooler to the professional ranks with a $1.625MM bonus. While he’s shown flashes at times, including a big 2013 season at Double-A (.284/.356/.435 with 24 steals), Fields has yet to show that he can hit consistently at the highest level of the minors.
