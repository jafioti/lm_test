Tottenham are one of the clubs showing an interest in Benfica winger Eduardo Salvio after watching him in action last weekend.

Salvio is understood to have been the man Spurs scouts had their eye on at the Portuguese club’s league game against Vitoria Setubal two days ago.

The Argentinian played the full 90 minutes as his team won 3-0.

Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino wants to sign another wide attacker in the summer and his compatriot Salvio, 24, is on the radar, although Standard Sport understands Benfica would not be interested in selling for anything less than £25million.

Chairman Daniel Levy is likely to spend such a sum only if he can guarantee recouping significant funds from sales, or if Spurs qualify for the Champions League.

Salvio, who has five caps for Argentina, first appeared on Tottenham’s radar in the Europa League tie between the sides last March. In the second leg in Lisbon, Salvio produced an excellent performance in the 2-2 draw that was enough to send Benfica through.

Salvio is a quick, skilful player who operates on the right flank and is adept at winning his duel with the opposing full-back. He is predominantly right-footed and has a ratio of one goal roughly every four matches.

Salvio first moved to Europe in January 2010, when Atletico Madrid signed him from Lanus for about £7.5m. Before the start of the following campaign, he joined Benfica on loan, and after returning to Atletico for the 2011/12 campaign, Salvio moved to Benfica permanently in July 2012. The total cost of the move was reported to be £10m.
