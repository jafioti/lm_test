In his latest book, A Capitalism for the People, Professor Luigi Zingales draws a distinction between being pro-market and pro-business. In our interview with him below, Zingales explains this essential distinction and some of the other important aspects of his superb book. He also explains why Donald Trump is the epitome of a pro-business capitalist and why this is a major problem.

Growing up in Italy, Dr. Luigi Zingales experienced firsthand a pro-business capitalist economy— wasteful government subsidies, regulations tailored to serve the interests of corporations, and a system in which connections were more important than merit. Wanting to live in the most competitive and inclusive economic system on the planet, Zingales moved to the United States. However, Zingales now sees the US looking more like Italy – corporate cronyism and monopoly increasingly ruining the economy.
