OKLAHOMA CITY — Gov. Mary Fallin is criticizing the federal courts for allowing gay marriage in Oklahoma, saying the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is a violation of states’ rights.

The U.S. Supreme Court without comment on Monday declined to take up an appeal in cases from several states, including Oklahoma, a move that effectively means gay marriage is legal in 30 states.

The decision was hailed by same-sex marriage supporters as a victory for gay rights, but Fallin said it infringes upon the will of Oklahoma voters, who supported a gay marriage ban in 2004 with more than 75 percent of the vote.

Fallin says the people’s will has been “overridden by unelected federal justices, accountable to no one.”

She says she believes Oklahoma voters have a right to define marriage.
