Every season, we see players rise and fall in the NBA. Superstars ascend to new heights, the former generation takes one step closer to being forgotten and the players in between just try to remain relevant from a year-to-year basis.

For most players, it’s easy to predict what kind of season they’ll have. After spending years in the league, the more consistent scorers have already established themselves and given the fans a clear idea of what to expect. But these guys aren’t robots, and as such, some of them are prone to off years depending on their new team, new role, or just not being able to put the ball in the hole.

Now, we’re only two weeks into the 2015-16 regular season, but we’ve already seen quite a few notable players struggle out of the gate. In the interest of determining which shooting slumps might last and which ones need to be swept under the rug, we’re going to take a look at 15 players who are still trying to find their rhythm this season.

For the sake of our list, rookies were not considered since most first-year players struggle to adjust to the speed, rhythm and range of the NBA game. We’re also ignoring guys like Michael Carter-Williams, Rajon Rondo, Ricky Rubio and other notorious 40 percent shooters, since we already know that field goal efficiency is not their forte.

Without further ado, here are the 15 players dealing with early season shooting slumps who need to break free for the good of their respective teams.
