It is the end of the season and Houston Texans J.J. Watt was a captain for the Pro Bowl selection for Cris Carter’s team. This marks Watt’s third consecutive selection to the Pro Bowl and he put together a Texans friendly team.

Watt made the first selection of the Pro Bowl Fantasy draft with Andrew Luck and called him the “the neck-beard with the arm” announcing him as the top overall selection.

To make matters even better Watt put the “band” back together for the Pro Bowl selecting current Texans offensive lineman Duane Brown and past Texans in Justin Forsett (Ravens), Glover Quin (Lions), Mario Williams (Bills) and Connor Barwin (Eagles) for Carter’s team who will be coached by John Harbaugh for the game.

It is good to see Watt getting some familiar faces back together.
