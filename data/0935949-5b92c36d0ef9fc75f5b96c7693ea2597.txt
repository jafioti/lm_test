An arrest that went down early Monday morning in North Portland is one that cops will talk about years from now because it has too many strange elements to make anything but routine.

You doubt?

Well, the man arrested tried running from a cop, but fell because his pants were down – that's part of the story – and they became tangled up around his ankles.

It all began just after 12:35 a.m. when a cop was asked to check out a report of a man who was exposing himself for "sexual gratification" while watching a woman, the Portland Police Bureau reported.

Apparently there was no question of intent.

The man, identified as Joey D. Vandervort, 19, attempted to punch the officer in the face. The officer dodged the blow to the face, but the punch hit the officer's lapel microphone.

Vandervort tried running away, fell because his pants were down, police said.

Vandervort flipped on his back and assumed what police said was a "ground-fighting stance" – what those MMA fighters do when they've been knocked down.

Instead of staying down, police said, he tried taking off again.

But, once again, he tripped over his pants.

By then, other officers had arrived and arrested Vandervort after a struggle in which an officer sustained a minor injury to his hand.

Vandervort, who claimed to be under the influence of a stimulant, was transported to an area hospital to be treated.

He was then taken to the Multnomah County Jail and charged with assaulting a police officer, second-degree disorderly conduct, indecent exposure, public indecency, interfering with a police officer and resisting arrest.
