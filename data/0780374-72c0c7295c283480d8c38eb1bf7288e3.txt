I don’t know too much about the video just that you can see Albuquerque police shoot another unarmed victim. As you can clearly see in the video the cop immediately jumps out of his vehicle with another cop to the right of him and without hesitation shower him with a hail of gunfire I counted over 20x but i might have miscalculated. However make sure you get this out to the public as to bring justice to these murderers.
