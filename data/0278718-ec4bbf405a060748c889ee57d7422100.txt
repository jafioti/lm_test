Former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election Wednesday. The two-term Republican governor is running as a Libertarian, as he also did in 2012.

In an interview with Fox Business Network, Johnson declared his intentions and said the largest issue the country will have to deal with after President Barack Obama's presidency is a "$20 trillion debt." He went on to say the government is too big and "unwieldy."

"It's out of control," Johnson continued.

In 2012, Johnson received 0.99 percent of the popular vote, or a total of 1,275,971 votes, as the Libertarian Party's nominee. Johnson announced his candidacy via Twitter in 2011, first running for the Republican Party's nomination. He later dropped out of the GOP field and garnered the support of the Libertarian Party.
