Hart’s 18 seasons with the Cardinals are more than any other player in franchise history, and his 199 games played are third-most, behind only kicker Jim Bakken (234) and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald (202). The only five players in NFL history with a longer stint on the same team are the Lions’ Jason Hanson (21 seasons); the Rams’ Jackie Slater (20); the Redskins’ Darrell Green (20), the Vikings’ Jim Marshall (19) and the Oilers/Titans’ Bruce Matthews (19).

“The Ring of Honor is reserved for those who have made the most extraordinary contributions to the Cardinals organization and Jim Hart is absolutely in that category,” Bidwill said in a statement. “When you look back at his career, two things really jump out: excellence and longevity.

“He is our franchise’s career leader in nearly every passing category which is commendable in its own right. But an undrafted quarterback going on to play 18 seasons and 199 games may be even more remarkable and unlikely to ever be duplicated. The impact he had on the Cardinals was undeniable and we are thrilled that he will have this permanent place of honor within our franchise.”

Hart is excited for the ceremony, especially because he gets to share it with his family and former teammates. He went to Philadelphia last week and announced the Cardinals’ second-round draft selection of safety Budda Baker. During that trip, Hart felt camaraderie with the other former players who were there, and it harkened him back to his playing days.

“That’s the special thing about it,” Hart said. “I’ll talk to people and they ask me, do I miss the game? No. How I could I play at this age? I miss my buddies, the guys I spent 8-to-10 hours a day with for six months a year.”
