The Muirskate Team Series Podium wheel is a 73mm tall X 64mm wide square-lipped downhill wheel that is ideal for acceleration and predictable drifting. The large inner race-core of the Podium provides the support and strength throughout the surface of the wheel, especially at the lip where grip initiates. The large race-core also maintains the shape of the wheel. Podiums are fast, predictable, and don't chunk under pressure.

What should I expect from my first experience on Team Series Podiums?

We've tested hundreds of sets of Podiums down the best and worst of hills. Riding down a hill on a smooth surface is the ideal situation for any race wheel. Podiums initiate not a powerful grip, but rather a grip that is predictable enough to brake in the corner while not losing your speed in the exit. There is no screeching to a halt reaction under the board. The first two or three pre-drifts are what you would expect in a race situation. You find a significant amount of mold-release even after several drifts.

Roll-speed is important in any race wheel. Even on the most dilapidated surfaces, Podiums accelerate and rebound quickly over rough pavement allowing them to hold speed equal to top race wheels in their class.

"Winning isn't everything", so they say. While others say "If you are not first, you are last".
