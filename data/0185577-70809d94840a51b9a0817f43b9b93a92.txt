KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. (KOIN) - A 61-year-old woman who told police her boyfriend accidentally shot himself in the chest was arrested for murder.

Kim Johnson Noud was arrested on September 27 by Klamath Falls police after officers responded to reports of a shooting in the 1900 block of Johnson Avenue.

Her boyfriend, Kenneth Wilkinson, accidentally shot himself in the chest while playing with a handgun, Noud allegedly told police. Noud claimed Wilkinson was seated in the living room and she was in the kitchen cooking.

Police, though, determined Wilkinson was shot in his back.

"Blood patterns, the position of a firearm and other evidence at the scene did not appear to be consistent with Kim Noud's statements," according to police.

Noud was arraigned on Monday on charges of murder and unlawful use of a weapon. She is scheduled to appear back in court on Oct. 5.
