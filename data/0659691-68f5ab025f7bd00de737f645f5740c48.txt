Meet Kai

Kai is one, stunning girl! She weighs just over 80lbs and is not quite 2yrs old. Her actual breed name (papered) in NAID - North American Indian Dog. She is very sweet.... and also quite timid with adults... but she LOVES children! She's also great with other dogs and actually, she must have another large male dog in the home to help her feel a bit more secure... and to help her become more confident. She is fully house trained and can be trusted home alone for many hours. She's also fully crate trained. She grew up in a home with 3 young children and another large dog - but they've decided that now they are too busy with soccer schedules so gave up the family pets. The male has already been adopted and Kai is still a bit bewildered about what is happening. She's really a wonderful girl - looking for a forever home. Since she loves to spend her days outdoors, she must also have an adequately sized, securely fenced backyard.
