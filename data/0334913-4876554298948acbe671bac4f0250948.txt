MOBILE, Alabama -- The Mobile Fire-Rescue Department is giving the public a first-hand look at the training behind first-responders in the Port City during the department's Citizens Academy.

Officials announced they have started accepting applications for their summer academy, which is scheduled to start August 12. Classes will be held from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. each Monday for 10 weeks.

The academy is free and open to anyone 21 years old and older.

"It would be great if we could get every citizen in Mobile in this," said Steve Huffman, public information officer for MFRD. "Most people don't see what we do -- don't know what we do. There are very few things that we don't respond to."

Included in the hands-on experiences provided during the academy is the chance to tour the mouth of the Mobile River on MFRD's fireboat Phoenix and see how the department responds to fires on the water.

Participants will also have the chance to practice using the heavy Jaws of Life to break open a locked car and rappel down a 4-story drill tower at the department's Training Academy. A firefighting demonstration and CPR training are also included in the classes.

"Experienced fire and emergency medical personnel, all within the ranks of the Mobile Fire-Rescue Department, will teach the Citizens Academy curriculum," Huffman said.
