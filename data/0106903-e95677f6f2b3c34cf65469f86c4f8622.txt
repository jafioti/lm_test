Karlsson is 1 away from tying Daigle with 172 career points for #Sens. Until then, EK will continue to toil in Daigle's immense shadow.

After the game, Erik Karlsson picks up the puck. "Here's a present for your kids.", he says as he hands it to Alfie.

Still waiting for Ryan to take a bite out of Anaheim's goalie. He's a danish!(person)

Still trying. 28.4 seconds left. Perfect time to start the wave. https://t.co/Ehsn5GlsO0

@BonksMullet Look on the bright side. After this game we won't play. Sharks 'til the Final.

“@alexklages: @BonksMullet Got my Pascal Leclaire hat today. Thanks to you and the @sensfoundation for the hat!” Be careful, it's delicate..

First pics of Mika Zibanejad reacting to being recalled are coming out now... #Sens pic.twitter.com/HSutwB8rxO

Maybe the organization sent Zibanejad down to prove to fans that they could bring Swedish fan favorites back.

if a cop in your men's league misses an open net he's required by law to tell you if he's erik condra

In Erik Karlsson's defense. Technically he does skate on water. #Sens

Never forget

It was a great week for Sens fans if you ignore every game except the Detroit one, so we've largely done that for this week's edition of Sens Tweets of the Week. Here's last week's edition if you missed it . Somehow the Edmonton game last Sunday got lost in between our two posts, much like Craig Anderson this week.
