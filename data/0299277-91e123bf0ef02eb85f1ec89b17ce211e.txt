For the past few months the story of the Awan brothers has continued to be ignored completely by the mainstream media.

The brothers Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan, all born in Pakistan, all with connections to the Muslim brotherhood; are at the center of a widespread criminal investigation by United States Capitol Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

After the arrest of Imran Awan, while trying to flee the United States, it's reigniting the precious allegations that suggest that Wasserman-Schultz’s missing computer that she freaked out over on film may contain evidence of not only overcharging taxpayers for congressional IT equipment, but possibly blackmailing members of Congress with secrets captured from emails.

To backtrack a bit, the Awan brothers were Pakistani IT specialists, who worked privately for at least 30 House and Senate prominent Democrats , as well as Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, as her personal technicians.

The new scandal involving Imran Awan being arrested, and now being charged with bank fraud himself, has raised questions about who may have been passed data which the Awans had access to, given Pakistan's history of collaborating with a number of foreign countries, which have direct ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, who have all demonstrated past willingness to influence United States politics.

The <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/23/exclusive-fbi-seized-smashed-hard-drives-from-wasserman-schultz-it-aides-home/">Daily Caller</a> is now reporting FBI agents have potentially seized a number of "smashed hard drives" and other computer equipment from their former residence in Virginia:

<i>”FBI agents seized smashed computer hard drives from the home of Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s information technology (IT) administrator, according to an individual who was interviewed by Bureau investigators in the case and a high level congressional source.”</i>

<i>”Pakistani-born Imran Awan, long-time right-hand IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman, has since desperately tried to get the hard drives back, the individual told The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group.”</i>

<i>”The congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe, confirmed that the FBI has joined what Politico previously described as a Capitol Police criminal probe into “serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network” by Imran and three of his relatives, who had access to the emails and files of the more than two dozen House Democrats who employed them on a part-time basis.”</i>

<i>”Capitol Police have also seized computer equipment tied to the Florida lawmaker.

Makes you wonder whether they used the official BleachBit hammer to destroy the hard drives.”</i>

As if it's not already incriminating enough, out of nowhere Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’s office has reportedly now terminated the employment of Imran Awan after his arrest. Apparently it didn't concern the office to do so before, which implies they were still involved with one another.

One of the most crucial points to this entire investigation is that the mainstream media has failed to publish that Imran Awan had access to Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s iPad password, which means that the Awans, of whom are tied to the Muslim Brotherhood, also had direct access to the now infamous DNC emails.

Federal investigators say the Awans are accused of removing hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment from congressional offices, including computers and servers, while also running a procurement scheme in which they bought equipment, then overcharged the House administrative office that assigns such contractors to members.

Some of the technology aides believe that the Awan’s are blackmailing representatives, using the personal contents of their emails and files, due to the fact that these representatives have displayed unwavering and intense loyalty towards the former aides.

There was a groundbreaking report from <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/265729/muslim-brotherhood-security-breach-congress-daniel-greenfield">FrontPageMag</a> which suggests there was widespread Muslim Brotherhood security breach in congress, and that there's a national security risk swamp to drain:

<i>”Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information.”</i>

<i>”The signatories to the letter were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security.”</i>

<i>”Two of them have been linked to an emerging security breach.”</i>

<i>”The office of Andre Carson, the second Muslim in Congress, had employed Imran Awan. As did the offices of Jackie Speier and Debbie Wasserman Schultz; to whom the letter had been addressed.”</i>

<i>”Imran Awan and his two brothers, Jamal and Abid, are at the center of an investigation that deals with, among other things, allegations of illegal access. They have been barred from the House of Representatives network.”</i>

<i>”A member of Congress expressed concern that “they may have stolen data from us.”</i>

<i>”All three of the Pakistani brothers had been employed by Democrats. The offices that employed them included HPSCI minority members Speier, Carson and Joaquín Castro. Congressman Castro, who also sits on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, utilized the services of Jamal Moiz Awan. Speier and Carson’s offices utilized Imran Awan.”</i>

<i>”Abid A. Awan was employed by Lois Frankel and Ted Lieu: members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Also on the committee is Castro. As is Robin Kelly whose office employed Jamal Awan. Lieu also sits on the subcommittees on National Security and Information Technology of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.”</i>

<i>”Tammy Duckworth’s office had also employed Abid. Before Duckworth successfully played on the sympathy of voters to become Senator Tammy Duckworth, she had been on the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces of the Armed Services Committee.”</i>

<i>”Gwen Graham, who had also been on the Armed Services Committee and on the Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee, had employed Jamal Awan. Jamal was also employed by Cedric Richmond’s office. Richmond sits on the Committee on Homeland Security and on its Terrorism and Cybersecurity subcommittee. He is a ranking member of the latter subcommittee. Also employing Jamal was Mark Takano of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.”</i>

<i>”Imran had worked for the office of John Sarbanes who sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee that oversees, among other things, the nuclear industry. Other members of the Committee employing the brothers included Yvette Clarke, who also sits on the Bipartisan Encryption Working Group, Diana DeGette, Dave Loebsack and Tony Cardenas.”</i>

<i>”But finally there’s Andre Carson.”</i>

<i>”Carson is the second Muslim in Congress and the first Muslim on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and, more critically, is the ranking member on its Emerging Threats Subcommittee. He is also a member of the Department of Defense Intelligence and Overhead Architecture Subcommittee.”</i>

What this essentially implies is the possibility is that the Awan Brothers are potential Muslim Brotherhood plants, which have blackmailed multiple members of Congress, and used that information which they could linger over the heads of both Senators and Representatives, to either exploit them for financial gain, or influence policy which benefits the Muslim Brotherhood.

Now what next begs to question; is how can we be certain Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’s office or herself wasn't directly involved in their manipulation attempts? Was she a pawn being used as well, or was she acting as an agent for Hillary Clinton to ensure the Clintonian power structure remained over the DNC?

<strong>Both are possibilities, but that's for you to determine. There's undoubtedly foul play, but how far down that rabbit hole of deception and betrayal, or even murderous treason it goes, remains to be seen.</strong>
