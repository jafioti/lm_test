Arch grounds openings

Here's a look at what has opened as part of the Arch grounds project, and a rough timeline of when other parts of the work are expected to be complete:

Nov. 25, 2015: The Luther Ely Smith Square reopens. It now runs from the Old Courthouse on North Fourth Street up and onto the Arch grounds. It will lead directly into the new entrance of the Arch visitors center and museum.

Thursday: A "picnic on the riverfront" is set to celebrate the opening of the revamped Arch riverfront beginning at 5 p.m.

Saturday: Leonor K. Sullivan Boulevard to open to traffic. It has been closed in chunks since late 2013.

Fall of 2016: The land around the Arch is slated to reopen.

Spring of 2017: Keiner Plaza is expected to reopen. Construction began in February to fill and raise the sunken amphitheater on the park's west end, as well as to add a large central lawn, a new fountain for the old "Runner" statue, interactive fountains, a woodland garden, bike parking, cafe seating and wider sidewalks.
