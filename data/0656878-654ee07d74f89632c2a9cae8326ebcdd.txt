Absolutely decimating the concept that negative reviews have an adverse affect on box office receipts, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice took this weekend with an absolutely massive $424.1 million worldwide. Domestically, the film took some $170.1 million, which combined with $254 million in international markets to get to the humongous global figure.

In the wake of these figures, Zack Snyder‘s epic adaptation of the DC properties, and opening salvo for his Justice League movies, has broken a number of records, both domestically and internationally. Stateside, this marked the biggest opening for Warner Bros. to date, narrowly beating out Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. It also marks the biggest domestic opening of 2016 (previously held by Deadpool) and of any Easter weekend beforehand (previously held by Furious 7), while this also marks the largest debut for both DC and Snyder.

The superhero showdown also had the biggest March opening of all time, beating out The Hunger Games, and ended up being Warner Bros.’s biggest opening thus far in China. The film opened in 66 markets internationally, and was seen on well over 44,000 screens, which is simply unprecedented in the history of American films overseas.

Of course, it wasn’t the only film that made money this weekend, just the clear winner. After three weeks of excellent business, Zootopia dipped to second place with a still impressive $23.1 million domestically, while My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 ended up taking the third spot with a relatively estimable $18.1 million. Elsewhere, The Divergent Series: Allegiant continued its meager earning streak with an estimated $9.5 million, and the faith-centric Miracles from Heaven also reached an equal weekend total of $9.5 million.
