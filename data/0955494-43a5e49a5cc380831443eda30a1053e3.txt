The idea came to cofounder and psychotherapist Rachel Weinstein after she saw a sign for an insurance company offering to teach “grown-up insurance stuff” to young adults. Her partner is Katie Brunelle, a health coach and sales guru, according to Next Avenue.

“Most people over 50 are adept at the practical life skills necessary to be successful adults,” said Brunelle. “Since the baby boomer generation was more inclined to learn these skills from their parents or from the school they attended, it is confusing to most of them as to how these skills ended up dropping off.”

Starting in April, students will pay $19.99 for a monthly subscription to take online classes on topics such as finances, make it/fix it and relationships. Mini lessons are also offered, such as How to Remove A Red Wine Stain, Next Avenue reports.
