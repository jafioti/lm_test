The Nashville Predators are about to see significant savings in their electric bill – simply by switching out a few light bulbs.

Actually, it’s a bit more complicated than that. The Predators ripped out the old metal halide lights from the rafters and replaced them with half as many LED fixtures.

“These LED lights — they do not emit heat off the lit part of the fixture. The old metal halides emit a lot of heat and that heat is projected down to the ice surface,” said Tim Friedenberger, VP of facility operations for Bridgestone Arena and the Predators.

“So, what this is going to allow us to do is hopefully create — I shouldn’t say hopefully — it will allow us to create a better ice surface for our players.”

And unlike the old lights which took five minutes to warm up, the new ones can turn on immediately. The lights can also change colors and create a strobe effect.

Ephesus Lighting installed the LEDs. The company previously installed a similar lighting system for the NHL's Ottawa Senators.

The cooler lighting is part of $10 million worth of upgrades to the arena this season, including new seats, concession stands, restrooms and metal detectors.
