The health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff is one of the highest priorities for The University of Alabama. As a result, over the past two decades, we have taken steps to help protect the campus community from the dangers of second-hand smoke. UA has not allowed smoking inside University buildings since 1991. In 2007, the policy was expanded to ban smoking within 30 feet of University buildings with the exception of one exit. Effective Jan. 1, 2015, The University of Alabama will extend its smoke-free policy to include all facilities, grounds and parking areas on the UA campus.

The Faculty Senate, the Professional Staff Assembly, the Office, Clerical and Technical Assembly, the Black Faculty/Staff Association and the UA Association of Residential Communities have passed resolutions in support of a smoke-free campus. The University Recreation Center and the Colleges of Nursing, Community Health Sciences and Communication and Information Sciences have already designated their areas as smoke-free. With this decision, UA joins approximately 1,400 colleges and universities around the country who have implemented a smoke-free policy campuswide.

The Student Health Center, the Office of Health Promotion and Wellness, and the College of Community Health Sciences/University Medical Center will offer assistance to individuals who want to stop smoking. Faculty and staff covered by the Universityâ€™s insurance plan will be provided current benefits for smoking cessation products and services. At this time, this includes a waiver of co-pays for some services.

Whether you are a smoker or a non-smoker, UA knows that the campus community will demonstrate thoughtfulness, consideration and cooperation as we work together to successfully implement this campuswide policy.
