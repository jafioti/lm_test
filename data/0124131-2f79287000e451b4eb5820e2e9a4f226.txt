This forum thread is for QUESTIONS ABOUT DESKTOP BULLDOZER / ZAMBEZI ONLY. ONE CLEAR AND CONCISE QUESTION PER POST.

Questions not following the above outlined formatting will be deleted and your account will disabled till the interview is published.

AMD approached me and expressed a desire to reach out to the members of the enthusiast hardware community about Bulldozer. We discussed a couple of approaches on how to do this and we decided that we would host this HardForum thread for our readers to post their questions in. AMD will then have the questions in hand and will internally deliver the questions to the persons at AMD that should best answer those. Once our questions are answered by AMD, we will construct an interview article and publish it for you to read. Surely we will discuss that as well.These questions should be constructed using proper grammar, spelling, and most of all, etiquette.So please think before you submit your question, and please take this opportunity seriously. We have this chance to subvert all of the rumor mills and get our information straight from the AMD source(s). I think our community can embrace this event and get the answers it wants and the answers I truly think it deserves.Should you be unaware of the Bulldozer launch, you can read our review here
