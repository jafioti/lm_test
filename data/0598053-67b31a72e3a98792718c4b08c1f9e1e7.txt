It all began as if by accident.

Who would win in a staff battle between @sciencemuseum and @NHM_London, what exhibits/items would help you be victorious? #askacurator â€” Bednarz (@bednarz) September 13, 2017

Before the Natural History Museum kicked it off like this.

We have dinosaurs. No contest. â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 13, 2017

The neighbouring Science Museum replied like this.

@NHM_London is full of old fossils, but we have robots, a Spitfire and ancient poisons. Boom! #AskACurator https://t.co/lsdOS3HqyO â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 13, 2017

And then it all really kicked off.

We have robot dinosaurs, Pterodactyls and the most venomous creatures on Earth. Plus volcanoes and earthquakes â€¦ And vampire fish. pic.twitter.com/H2dNv0wgQr â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 13, 2017

What about this merman & we do have a Polaris nuclear missile as Khalil says! pic.twitter.com/uczMFrvKIw â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 13, 2017

Jenny Haniver sees your merman, never bring a nuke to an earth-shattering meteorite fight, and our cockroach specimens w/ survive us all ðŸ˜‰ pic.twitter.com/mbEgDseZ7G â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 13, 2017

We see your cockroach andâ€¦ whack it with a welly pic.twitter.com/ITEPuplGHK â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 13, 2017

There is never just one cockroach. And we quietly melt your plastics with our lava. pic.twitter.com/DaaJc5V5lJ â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 13, 2017

Weâ€™ll (hopefully) fight your lava with all our fire engines https://t.co/gRECpigRYt pic.twitter.com/n57QKfDcag â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 13, 2017

*Game of Thrones theme music* Send in the (sea)-dragonsâ€¦ (from The Book of the Great Sea-Dragons by Thomas Hawkins, 1840). pic.twitter.com/K4Duh3w7Vk â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 13, 2017

We see your dragons and have escaped in this bathyscaphe https://t.co/m4gMCpGNxq pic.twitter.com/zqs0YwiQRO â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 13, 2017

It may be a good idea to avoid our Fossil Marine Reptiles gallery in that. Chomp, chomp: https://t.co/bxYONpujYn pic.twitter.com/BaqHF80tjl â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 13, 2017

We were all set to call it a draw, but then we saw this. Turns out, we have a dinosaur AND itâ€™s 3D printed! pic.twitter.com/vLRK0PI5JE â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 14, 2017

OK, we werenâ€™t going to do this, but here come the locustsâ€¦ Phymateus viridipes, Phymateus karschi, and Ornithacris pictula magnificaâ€¦ pic.twitter.com/LWq6WfCCB9 â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 14, 2017

And this locust is one you can see on the balconies of the new #HintzeHall. pic.twitter.com/Gpbtivr28T â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 14, 2017

Obviously we wonâ€™t use this DDT Insect Spray (on display in our new Mathematics Gallery) https://t.co/vQzoHMaSD5 so insteadâ€¦. pic.twitter.com/t3imuW1WqP â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 14, 2017

â€¦ weâ€™ll fight them off with this Giant Killer, a British-made insect swatter from 1900-1930 https://t.co/gmSJeBurDA pic.twitter.com/jfG0SR54aU â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 14, 2017

Youâ€™re going to need a bigger swatter. Victorians had to shoot some insects like the Goliath beetle out of the sky https://t.co/K8fRIpiyoL pic.twitter.com/dH1CmSzFNl â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 14, 2017

Ah, you mean something like this 1860s London-made Enfield carbine rifle? pic.twitter.com/r2sHbF41MN â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 14, 2017

Weâ€™d see that coming from a mile off (Bold eagle by Klaus Nigge; one of the 100 photos in our upcoming #WPY53 exhib https://t.co/GyamMcKgPp) pic.twitter.com/KLa4vwaBjc â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 14, 2017

Time for us to try something stealthy, like this puma-leopard hybrid from our sister Museum in Hertfordshire, @NHM_Tring pic.twitter.com/UgVNAzgtOj â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 14, 2017

Ah, but we spotted your leopard from our balloon (Lunardiâ€™s second balloon ascending from St. Georgeâ€™s Fields, 1785) https://t.co/NctLaxzqB0 pic.twitter.com/gUQiaVPNJL â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 14, 2017

In 1785 youâ€™d be too distracted by our fleasâ€¦ they are legion (and even have there own twitter feed @NHM_Fleas) https://t.co/TvgIg9EoTf pic.twitter.com/ckOSo5ks8m â€” NaturalHistoryMuseum (@NHM_London) September 14, 2017

We would have caught the fleas in this Chinese bamboo flea trap (on show in our Making the Modern World gallery) https://t.co/4LI5va8ECv pic.twitter.com/7zWk3gzEgS â€” Science Museum (@sciencemuseum) September 14, 2017

We have MILLIONS OF FLEAS â€“ that would have to be a massive trap. Drop ðŸŽ¤ â€” NHM_Fleas (@NHM_Fleas) September 14, 2017
