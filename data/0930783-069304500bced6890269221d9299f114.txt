If T-shirt sales decided presidential elections, Ron Paul would beat out both President Obama and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, according to merchandise company CafePress. The online retailer has a meter that tracks political merchandise sales, 46 percent of which so far have been pro-Paul. But with 39 percent, Obama is not far behind the Texas congressman, especially compared to Romney's third place with just 15 percent in sales.



If Romney gets the GOP nomination in August, as predicted, Obama will be the presidential candidate in the lead for T-shirt sales, which should not be underestimated, says Marc Cowlin, CafePress's director of marketing. "We believe that how people spend their money is a great indicator of how they will ultimately vote," says Cowlin, adding that the sales meter successfully predicted Obama's win in 2008 over Sen. John McCain. Some of the political favorites, according to CafePress, are T-shirts that say: "Who Ever Heard of a Nice Piece of Elephant?" and "Keep Calm and Vote for Romney."
