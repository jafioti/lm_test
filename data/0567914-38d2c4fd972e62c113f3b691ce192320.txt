It’s set around the same time as the events of Darksiders 2, which was released almost five years ago, and will follow Fury’s quest to destroy unique physical versions of of the Seven Deadly Sins.

Gunfire Games’ development team includes multiple ex-Vigil Games employees who worked on Darksiders and Darksiders 2, including the Game Director, Executive Producer, Technical Director, Lead Environment Artist, and more.

Since the studio’s formation in 2014, they’ve worked on titles including Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition and Chronos, which was one of IGN’s nominees for the best VR game of 2016.

Lars Wingefors, Co-Founder and Group CEO at THQ Nordic AB said, “After countless rumors, a major catalogue acquisition, and even a corporate re-brand, the team at THQ Nordic is thrilled to finally confirm plans for Darksiders III.”

Darksiders 3 is the IGN First for May, so stay tuned for extensive coverage on everything we learned during our visit to Gunfire Games. The game is currently available for preorder on Amazon.
