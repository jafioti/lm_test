Trump ICE officials are targeting Obama’s “Unaccompanied Alien Children” gangbangers for deportation.

Via The Conservative Treehouse:

Many people might be familiar with the 2013/2014/2015 “Unaccompanied Alien Children” (UAC) crisis which stemmed from a specific President Obama policy/construct to allow a massive influx of South American migrants to enter the U.S.

Despite most media reports to the contrary, a considerable number of those UAC’s were teen and young gang members from South America, including MS-13 members. The aliens were granted entry by the Obama administration, supported by false assertions of refugee status and shipped to various regional locales.

Senator Ted Cruz, Media personality Glenn Beck and current NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch were part of the insufferable campaignto facilitate the influx. We know this, because CTH investigated the origin and large-scale purpose of the entire program. As time progressed it did not take long for many of these “UAC’s” to begin reengaging in illicit criminal activity in their relocated areas.

Today Reuters is reporting DHS intends to specifically target these illegal UAC criminal gang members for deportation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – U.S. immigration agents are planning nationwide raids next week to arrest, among others, teenagers who entered the country without guardians and are suspected gang members, in a widening of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigrants.
