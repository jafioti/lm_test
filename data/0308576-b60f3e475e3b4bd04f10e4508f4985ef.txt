Rumours suggest that the group will release a new track this week

Fans of The Stone Roses are speculating that the band could release a new single this week after mysterious lemon adverts were displayed on billboards around Manchester.

Manchester Evening News reports that the band’s iconic lemon logo appeared on digital advertising boards around Manchester city centre on Tuesday morning (May 10). Several fans have posted photos of the adverts to social media (see below).

The band have not yet commented on the matter and it is not known whether the adverts are for a potential new single that had been rumoured earlier in the week. The lemon poster tactic was employed last year when the band announced a run of live gigs.

Frontman Ian Brown confirmed to NME in March that the group were recording new material

Over the weekend, a fan named Lewis Jones allegedly ran into Stone Roses bassist Mani, who told him a single would be out “next week” (May 9-13). Mani also said to “stay tuned to the radio”.

Last November, similar lemon posters surfaced around Manchester, leading to the announcement of new Stone Roses gigs for 2016. However, a publicity stunt later that same month saw Stone Roses fans fooled as lemon posters were used to promote a cover band gig in Doncaster.
