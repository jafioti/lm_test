Greece, N.Y. - There has been another reported clown sighting in our area; this time, it was on Route 104 in Greece - and this time, there's actually video of it.

The person who took the video said they captured the person dressed in a clown suit walking down West Ridge Road, not far from Greece Ridge Mall, Sunday night.

The individual told 13WHAM the person was, “waving at cars."

Greece’s police chief said they're not worried, even as Halloween approaches.

Chief Patrick Phelan said it’s not illegal to dress as a clown; however, it is if the clowns start to harass and scare people.

“There's quite a bit of hysteria,” Phelan said. “I don't think the very fact that someone is dressed as a clown is in and of itself sinister in any way."

But it comes as "creepy clown" sightings are becoming a national trend. Many are posted to social media, and police suspect that is what's fueling it.

"I think the attention around this, there's a lot of urban legend - I don't expect any problems,” said Phalen. “We have no issues. I think the attention will inspire some people to dress as clowns. But I don't expect any problems."

If someone dressed as a clown is attempting to intentionally scare others, police want you to call 911.
