Anti-LGBT pundit Scott Lively argues in a column today that the only way to stop the legalization of gay marriage is to form an “angry mob” that will take to “the streets, pitchforks and torches held aloft, ready to tear down Frankenstein’s castle with their bare hands if need be.”

“The only way to deter the elites is with the threat of the mob,” Lively writes in a piece posted in the right-wing outlets BarbWire and WorldNetDaily. “They need to see the pitchforks and torches to know they’ve gone too far and need to back down. That’s where we are today in America. The elites want to eliminate the natural family to create a better class of serfs: state-bred children for the factories and the battlefield — easier to control, dulled by drugs and sexual promiscuity … and bread and circuses.”

Calling for liberals and conservatives to unite behind opposition to gay rights, he warns that marriage equality is akin to GMO foods or medication that is “destroying bodies” with “poisonous ‘remedies.’”
