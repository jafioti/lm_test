The Detroit Lions 2017 Schedule Has Been Released, Check Out The Match Ups Below.

While the NFL Draft is coming up next week, the 2017 schedule was released today for all 32 teams in the NFL. Detroit was tied for 27th in schedule toughness before the schedule was released last season. Coming before the announcement of the 2017 schedule, Detroit is ranked 21st for toughest schedule, so with a 9-7 season in the books, Detroit has tougher competition. Check out the schedule below.

Week 17 vs. Green Bay Packers 12/31/17 1 p.m. FOX

Overall, Detroit’s schedule seems about equal with last years. The good news is they play the Cleveland Browns and are home against the Steelers and Falcons, two tough games that will be easier with the home crowd on their side. Bad news for Detroit and it is that they play at Chicago and at Green Bay during November and that is when it becomes tougher to play football outside. Also, Green Bay is one of the three prime time games for the Lions, so the crowd will be even louder and crazier come week nine.

Detroit plays Minnesota on Thanksgiving, which should be where Detroit debuts their new throwback jerseys. Detroit has a total of three prime time games; New York, Pittsburgh, Green Bay.

What do you think of the 2017 schedule for the Detroit Lions? Think that Detroit has a chance to get back into the playoffs, or will Detroit sit on the sidelines come January?
