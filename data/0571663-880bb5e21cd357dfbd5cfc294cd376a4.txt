Early life and ministry Edit

Founding of school and religious congregation Edit

Expansion of the Sisters of St Joseph Edit

Excommunication Edit

Bishop Sheil spent less than two years of his episcopate in Adelaide and his absences and poor health left the diocese effectively without clear leadership for much of his tenure. This resulted in bitter factionalism within the clergy and disunity among the lay community. After the founding of the Josephites, Sheil appointed Woods as director general of Catholic education.[16] Woods came into conflict with some of the clergy over educational matters[17] and local clergy began a campaign to discredit the Josephites. As well as allegations of financial incompetence, rumours were also spread that MacKillop had a drinking problem. In fact, it was widely known that she drank alcohol on doctor's orders to relieve the symptoms of dysmenorrhea, which often led to her being bedridden for days at a time. A 2010 investigation by the Revd Paul Gardiner, chaplain of the Mary MacKillop Penola Centre, found no evidence to support these allegations.[14] In early 1870, MacKillop and her sister Josephites heard of allegations that Father Patrick Keating, of Kapunda parish to Adelaide's north, had been sexually abusing children.[18] The Josephites informed Father Woods, who in turn informed the vicar general, Father John Smyth, who ultimately sent Keating back to Ireland.[18] The reason for Keating's dismissal was publicly thought to be alcohol abuse.[19] Keating's former Kapunda colleague, Father Charles Horan OFM, was angered by Keating's removal and there is evidence to suggest he sought revenge against Woods by attacking the Josephites.[18] Horan became acting vicar general after the death of Smyth in June 1870 and from this position sought to influence Bishop Sheil.[19] Horan met with Sheil on 21 September 1871 and convinced him that the Josephites' constitution should be changed in a way that could have left the Josephite nuns homeless; the following day, when MacKillop apparently did not accede to the request, Sheil excommunicated her, citing insubordination as the reason.[17][18] Though the Josephites were not disbanded, most of their schools were closed in the wake of this action.[17] Forbidden to have contact with anyone in the church, MacKillop lived with a Jewish family and was also sheltered by Jesuit priests. Some of the sisters chose to remain under diocesan control, becoming popularly known as "Black Joeys".[14][20] On his deathbed, Sheil instructed Horan to lift the excommunication on MacKillop.[14] On 21 February 1872, he met her on his way to Willunga and absolved her in the Morphett Vale church.[21] An episcopal commission later completely exonerated her. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) said in September 2010 that MacKillop had been "banished after uncovering sex abuse" and cited Father Paul Gardiner in evidence of this. Gardiner described this suggestion as false, saying "Early in 1870, the scandal occurred and the Sisters of Saint Joseph reported it to Father Tenison Woods, but Mary was in Queensland and no one was worried about her."[citation needed] The executive producer of the ABC documentary said that the documentary did not suggest that MacKillop was excommunicated because of her role in exposure of child abuse: "At no stage ... is it claimed Mary MacKillop was excommunicated because she personally reported instances of abuse to the Catholic Church."[22]

Rome Edit

After the acquisition of the Mother House in Kensington in 1872, MacKillop made preparations to leave for Rome to have the "Rule of Life" of the Sisters of St Joseph officially approved. MacKillop travelled to Rome in 1873 to seek papal approval for the religious congregation and was encouraged in her work by Pope Pius IX.[12] The authorities in Rome made changes to the way Josephite sisters lived in regards to their commitment to poverty[15] and declared that the superior general and her council were the authorities in charge of the congregation.[21] They assured MacKillop that the congregation and their "Rule of Life" would receive final approval after a trial period.[12] The resulting alterations to the "Rule of Life" regarding ownership of property caused a breach between MacKillop and Woods, who felt that the revised document compromised the ideal of vowed poverty and blamed MacKillop for not getting the document accepted in its original form.[17][21] Before Woods' death on 7 October 1889, he and MacKillop were personally reconciled, but he did not renew his involvement with the congregation.[21] While in Europe, MacKillop travelled widely to observe educational methods.[17] During this period, the Josephites expanded their operations into New South Wales and New Zealand. MacKillop relocated to Sydney in 1883 on the instruction of Bishop Reynolds of Adelaide.[15]

Return from Rome Edit

Death Edit

Life-size bronze statue of St Mary Mackillop by sculptor Linda Klarfeld at the Australian Catholic University in North Sydney MacKillop died on 8 August 1909 at the Josephite convent in North Sydney.[10] The Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Moran, said: "I consider this day to have assisted at the deathbed of a saint."[14] She was laid to rest at the Gore Hill cemetery, a few kilometres up the Pacific Highway from North Sydney. After MacKillop's burial, people continually took earth from around her grave. As a result, her remains were exhumed and transferred on 27 January 1914 to a vault before the altar of the Virgin Mary in the newly built memorial chapel in Mount Street, North Sydney.[30] The vault was a gift of Joanna Barr Smith, a lifelong friend and admiring Presbyterian.
