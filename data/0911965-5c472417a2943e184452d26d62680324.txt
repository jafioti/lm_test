It looks like a solution is nearing between the Celtics and Cavs following their blockbuster deal last week.

According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the two teams started to engage each other on a solution with the blockbuster deal on Tuesday.

After Isaiah Thomas' physical, the Cavs reportedly wanted more in return due to the shape of his injured hip. The report adds Cleveland is no longer seeking one of the Celtics' top young players or significant draft picks. They could be inclined to complete the deal for a late first-round pick or second-round considerations.

The Celtics and Cavaliers agreed on a deal to send Kyrie Irving to the Celtics in exchange for Thomas, forward Jae Crowder, center Ante Zizic and the Nets' 2018 first-round pick.

The deadline to report and submit to a physical for the players involved in the trade is 10 a.m. on Wednesday, and the deadline to pass the physical is 10 a.m. on Thursday.

Thomas spoke on record about his hip, which can be found here.
