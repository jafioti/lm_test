The legislation that was approved Sunday evening, after facing a revision, would apply only to settlements established with the involvement of the state -- which includes Amona, but not to those that were established without state involvement.

The Amona outpost was slated for demolition following a 2008 Israeli Supreme Court decision after eight Palestinians from neighboring villages -- with the support of Yesh Din -- successfully petitioned the court to remove the outpost on grounds that the construction was carried out on privately owned Palestinian land.

After years of appeals from right-wing Israeli government officials, and attempts by Amona settlers to prove they had legally purchased the land, an Israeli police investigation in May 2014 found the entirety of the outpost to have been built on private Palestinian lands, and that the documents used by Amona residents to try claim their "purchases" were in fact forged.

Meanwhile, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat warned on Monday that any dismantlement of the illegal Israeli outpost Amona in the occupied West Bank would be followed by the mass demolition of Palestinian homes lacking Israeli-issued building permits in East Jerusalem.

Following news of the law’s passage, Yesh Din on Twitter called the bill “a legal stunt designed to sanction takeover of Palestinian land in the West Bank,” saying it “exposes (the Israeli) government's intention to annex the West Bank to Israel without affording its residents civil rights.”
