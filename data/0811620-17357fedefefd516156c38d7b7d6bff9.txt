Over 300,000 West Virginians were left without water last week when a storage facility leaked several thousand gallons of a coal-processing chemical upstream from a water treatment plant.

While the water ban has been partially lifted and some residents have been allowed to run their water in order to "flush" the system, many are still seeing the effects of the chemical spill coming out of their taps.

I assume this is sediment. Flushed from the South Hills area. #WVWaterCrisis #wvchemleak pic.twitter.com/Xtw1bpDY6p — Chris Bailey (@Chrisdbailey) January 14, 2014
