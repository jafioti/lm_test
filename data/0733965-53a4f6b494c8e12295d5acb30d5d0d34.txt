Podolski: ‘I could stay at Inter’

By Football Italia staff

Lukas Podolski says he could stay at Inter beyond the summer, and targets a Europa League place.

The German striker is on loan from English Premier League side Arsenal, and had previously stated his desire to return to London at the end of the season.

“I train hard every day,” Podolski told Sky when asked about his future.

“I always want to play, but that’s up to the Coach. The important thing is to always have something to aim for.

“I can’t say now where I’ll be next year, I still have a year’s contract in London and I haven’t spoken with other clubs.

“I don’t know if I’ll stay here, but I’m open to any possibility. We’ll see what the future holds.

“I can stay here, go back to London or move elsewhere. I’ll make the right decision for myself and my family.”

After a slow start to life in Italy, the World Cup winner’s form has improved, and Podolski believes Europe is still attainable.

“It’s not easy when you come to a new League, especially a big, tough one like Serie A. I had to adjust, but I think I’ve succeeded now.

“We can get into the Europa League, we have four games to play and we’ll try and win them all. It’s true that we have two difficult games against Lazio and Juventus, but we’ll try to win them all if we can.

“It’s not totally in our hands, we’re depending on those above us losing at least one game, but I’m confident about ourselves.”
