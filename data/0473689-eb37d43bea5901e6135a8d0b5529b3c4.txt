Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, is to be re-hired by Rupert Murdoch.

She is expected to begin a new role at News Corp-owned media agency Storyful that will focus on new avenues for digital and social media.

Sources told the BBC no announcement was imminent and Ms Brooks' salary was "still being worked out."

The role is likely to be based in the UK but involve frequent trips to Dublin, where Storyful is based.

Ms Brooks is the former editor of the Sun and now defunct News of the World newspapers.

She was acquitted last year of charges related to phone hacking during her time as editor of both newspapers and perverting the course of justice.

The revelations that journalists at the News of the World hacked the phone of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002, ultimately led to the demise of the 178 year-old newspaper in 2011.

New boss

Storyful is an Irish social media news agency founded by former RTE current affairs presenter Mark Little and bought by News Corp in 2013 for Â£15m.

Current chief executive Rahul Chopra, who joined Storyful from News Corp as part of that takeover deal, only took up his current position in December, replacing Mr Little, who became director of editorial innovation.

He is a long time News Corp executive and, according to Storyful's website, also holds the position of senior vice president of video at News Corp, where he is responsible for video expansion across all of the company's properties worldwide.

He previously held several roles within business development at Dow Jones, primarily focusing on the Wall Street Journal's video, mobile and tablet expansion strategy.

Initial reports suggested Ms Brooks would be taking over at the top of Storyful, but sources told the BBC her role has yet to be fully determined.

No one from News Corp was available to provide comment.
