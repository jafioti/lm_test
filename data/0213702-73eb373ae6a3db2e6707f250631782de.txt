My students need flexible seating for flexible learning styles. I would like exercise balls, soft seats and yoga mats to help with flexible seating in my classroom. Having flexible seating will encourage engaging learning.

A typical day in my science classroom involves a lot of movement in each period. I have a broad range of needs in my classes, ranging from accelerated students to students that are very slow learners. Many of my students have ADHD. Keeping all students engaged, at all times is fun, yet challenging!

My school has an extremely high rate of free lunch students and we are the largest Title I school in the state.

Yet, they truly have the biggest hearts I have seen in my 10 years in education. My students come to school with a smile on their face, a polite "good morning" or "thank you" and a desire to please their teachers. They are genuinely good kids who face challenges in their daily lives and some of the stories break my heart as a mother and teacher. Despite what life is throwing at them, they are still working hard and still trying to do their very best. They have the hearts of champions and I love working with these student everyday!
