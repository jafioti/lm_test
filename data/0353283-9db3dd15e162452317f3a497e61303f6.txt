New Contest Lets Schools Get Creative and Win up to $ 5,000

Whether your school is private, charter, or public, chances are you could use some cash to bolster up your programs, renovate your classrooms, or even upgrade your technology. That’s the rationale behind a new contest being sponsored by GLTYR for Schools, which puts the power of school promotion in the palm of your hand, along with a chance to win serious cash prizes up to $5,000.

GLTYR, which stands for ‘Give Life To Your Reality’, is a multimedia mobile app that lets people create their own ‘commercials’ from their smartphones using a combination of video, audio, text and images. GLTYR for Schools is easy to use, churning out 30-second messages in under 5 minutes. The app actually creates a link that can be put on a website, texted or emailed to anyone, anywhere, no membership needed.

Now, a little about the contest. Participating schools can download the app free trial and each user may create as many ‘commercials’ (you might call them promos or spotlights or introductions) as you wish. Schools may enter up to 10 GLTYRs in the contest, with a maximum of 2 per user.

GLTYR has assembled a highly esteemed panel of judges to review entries and select the winners. Judges include Kevin O’Donnell, Senior Producer of Bravo TV, Tishin Donkersley, Chief Editor of AZ Tech Beat, Colin O’Donohoe, composer and leader of the Pangean Orchestra, and Sahana Jayaraman, VP of Eastwick Digital Marketing.

We almost forgot the best part of the competition. Whether your school wins a prize or not, the commercials you create for your school is yours to keep and use.

Good luck!
