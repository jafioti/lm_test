EX-CIA Names McCain, McMaster, Brennan as Masterminds of Syrian False Flag

I have a deep-inside source that confirms Independent Media reports which places Senator John McCain at the scene of the crime. In other words, he visited Syria only days before the false flag. Further, I have had it confirmed by the same source that McCain has been tabbed to be the public source espousing Deep State propaganda to push to America towards war based on false allegations of election tampering by the Russians.



Ex-CIA Identifies Forces Behind False Flag

Trump reacted to Syria 'emotionally, ineffectively, unconstitutionally'

Noting Trump had promised to extricate America from wars and not get involved in Syria, Buchanan said Trump is now “in a terrible box.”



“Now, the Syrians are not going to back down, the Russians are not going to back down, and as they continue the battle against the rebels – the U.S.-backed rebels as well as ISIS and al-Qaida – people are going to be demanding that Trump follow up,” he said.

Buchanan said the American people will not sustain a long war to determine who will rule Syria when there are about 10 parties “in there, fighting for various objectives they believe in far more deeply than any American believes that we ought to decide who runs Syria.”

“I don’t know what it is with the neocons, but there is just something with regard to Russia, that they cannot abide,” he said.
