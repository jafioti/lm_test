Is anyone in Westeros more emo than our favorite brooding bastard, Jon Snow? He loves to wear all black. His hair is perpetually in his face. He goes on and on about how he doesn’t feel accepted by his family. He even took an adorable baby dire wolf and named it “Ghost,” of all names — What’s more emo than that?!

It seems to me that Jon Snow is one pentagram stick-and-poke away from joining a late-90’s or early 2000’s emo band. So what do you say — can you differentiate some of Jon Snow’s famous quotes from the angstiest of emo song lyrics? Take this Game of Thrones trivia quiz to find out.
