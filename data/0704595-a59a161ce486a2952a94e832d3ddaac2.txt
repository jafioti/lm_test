Remember when I warned y'all about what might happen to some of our longtime independent restaurants? Well, the curse has struck at Jed's Sports Bar & Grill on 28th Avenue off of West End. Including its incarnation as The Acorn, the ownership group had operated at that location for more than 15 years, and as recently as Sunday was still offering wing and beer specials on its Facebook page to attract the football crowd in to watch the big game.

But little did we know that Super Sunday was to be Bloody Sunday as the restaurant shuttered the next day. According to a letter posted on the front door, "It is with heavy heart that we inform you that Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017 was our last day of business and Jed's is CLOSED as of Monday, Feb. 6."

The letter goes on to say that their current lease is up at the end of this month, and that they could not negotiate a building purchase or lease extension. Ownership has chosen to use the rest of February to vacate the premises. There is no official word about The Country Nashville, the bar and music venue next door that is operated by the same ownership group as Jed's. The music hadn't officially died there as of last night when they held their weekly Tuesday Night Pro Blues Jam, although it is rather ominous that the events calendar on their website ends abruptly on Feb. 13.

We'll keep an eye on the space to see what's next.

Update, 2 p.m.: We got this note from Lee Huber, the booking manager for The Country.
