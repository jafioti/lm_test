There are a number of questions that are asked in just about every Ask Me Anything (AMA) session that takes place on Reddit. One of them is about the preference for taking on 100 duck-sized horses (or just one horse-sized duck). The other? What’s your idea of a perfect sandwich?

The Perfect Sandwich is our weekly feature that pairs scientists, celebrities, politicians, and other icons with this universal question. This week brings us Joel Hodgson, creator of the classic cult TV series Mystery Science Theater 3000 and the man behind the record-breaking Kickstarter campaign to revive it.

Hodgson is a big fan of hummus, because “[i]t’s kinda like grown-up peanut butter in a way. It’s good for you. It’s kinda dense, but it really tastes good. It just makes the sandwich that much denser.”

Upvoted also asked Hodgson what he thought Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot—his robot pals from MST3K—might order on their sandwiches.

“I couldn’t even speculate on what they eat,” he said. “I don’t know.”

Clearly, all they want is a hamburger sandwich with a French fry garnish.
