Sling + OTA – Customers who live outside areas where locals are offered through Sling can receive select local channelslike ABC, CBS, FOX or NBC free in HD through an OTA antenna (based on geographic location). Plus, if you have an AirTV Player, your local channels will be integrated right into your Sling TV interface.

“Only AirTV Player integrates your local channels into your Sling TV experience for seamless access to football, including all your home team’s games for free! So save your money for game day snacks, beverages and friendly wagers.” AirTV said in a blog post today.

Sling TV seems to be pushing back against the trend of higher bills in exchange for locals. The question now is will their push to offer antennas as a free way to get locals will pay off.
