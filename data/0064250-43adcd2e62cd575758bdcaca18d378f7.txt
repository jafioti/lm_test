NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Titans are hiring Atlanta Falcons wide receivers coach Terry Robiskie as their new offensive coordinator, according to a source familiar with the Titans.

New Titans coach Mike Mularkey was Atlanta's offensive coordinator from 2008 to 2011, and Robiskie has been the Falcons' wide receivers coach since 2008.

At his introductory news conference, Mularkey confirmed that he had talked to Robiskie about the position but would only say that he was one of three coaches being considered for the job.

Mularkey said that the coach he hires as offensive coordinator would call the plays on offense next season.

Robiskie has served as offensive coordinator twice previously, with the Cleveland Browns in 2004 and the Raiders from 1989 to 1993. He has also served as an assistant with the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins.

Mularkey said Monday that Jason Michael, the Titans' offensive coordinator since 2014, will serve as quarterbacks coach. Michael had appeared in line to join the Rams.
