New Enemies

Sentient forces have appeared, but more are obscured from our sensors. Players can discover more about these ancient enemies in the Second Dream Quest.

Login Reward System Update

• The Login Reward System has been given a total overhaul, and will now give players increasingly valuable rewards with each daily login.

The following changes have been made to all Sniper Rifles:

o Firstly, your right mouse button is a 'held' aim.

o Secondly, your middle-mouse button (alt-fire) adjusts zoom levels.

• Each level of zoom will provide a stat bonus that is applied to each shot. These bonuses are specific to each Sniper Rifle and will be indicated in the scope.

• Successive kills with a Sniper Rifle will apply toward a combo counter, which will apply a damage bonus for each successive kills.

• The Sniper Rifle’s combo counter will reset after a period of delay, or when the player misses their next shot.

Sortie Missions

Sortie Missions are now available for all Tenno Mastery Rank 4 or higher!

o Earth, Tikal

o Europa, Cholistan

o Phobos, Zeugma

o Pluto, Hieracon

• Many Survival and Excavation missions have been rebalanced so that the mission rewards match the difficulty of the mission, the enemies spawned are appropriately challenging, and the enemy level scaling is consistent. This includes tuning such as reducing caps of Sapping Osprey, and ensuring similar leveled nodes have a similarly difficult mix of enemies.

o Malva, Wahiba, Elara, and Piscinas went from 'Easy' rewards to 'Medium'.

o Cameria, Cassini, and Selkie went from 'Hard' rewards to 'Medium'.

o Eris, Zalba

o Ceres, Gabii

• There is now a 30-Second window in Interception missions once you've intercepted the message to kill all enemies and collect loot. Once this 30 seconds is up, you'll be prompted by the Reward screen. This should prevent progression stoppers in Rounds where the game thinks there are enemies left.
