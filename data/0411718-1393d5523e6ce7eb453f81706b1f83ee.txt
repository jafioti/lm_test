NORTH Korea has claimed they will kill more people in America than the September 11 attacks.

A bizarre article in the country’s state-run publication DPRK Today said their weapons are trained on the White House, the Pentagon and other vital US locations.

“If three civilian aeroplanes’ attacks from 15 years ago resulted in 3000 deaths and brought a nightmare to life for the US, the outbreak of our final war will wipe the country from history, leaving no time [for them to] even regret or have nightmares about it,” the article reportedly said.

Kim Jong-un’s regime has issued a series of threats recently — even threatening long-time ally China.

“Being beaten by only three civilian aeroplanes, the US was ashamed in front of the world and has suffered incalculable psychological and economical damage,” the article added.

The article comes soon after Kim Jong-un defied a UN weapons ban to oversee the testing of North Korea’s new surface-to-air missiles — the country’s state media has reported.

The test comes amid growing tensions between the North Korea and South Korea as the dictatorship appears to step up its weapons program.

The communist state has declared itself in a state of “semi-war” and declared hostilities against a host of countries including America and China.

Kim Jong-un, 33, recently threatened “nuclear storm” against the country’s enemies after it was subjected to strict UN sanctions — which includes a ban on any missile tests.

Pyongyang’s official news agency said the leader had “guided the test of a new-type anti-air guided weapon system” to “estimate its performance”.
