You may think you've got a lot of air miles, but your points are nothing compared to the distance Tiesto and Paul van Dyk have under their belts.

TravelBird recently conducted a survey and found that the two dance music producers and DJs are in fact the most traveled artists in music history. The poll compiled all the distance traveled by compiling travel times for all tour dates announced since the beginning of artists' careers. Tiesto tops the list with an overwhelming 1,557,131 lifetime miles, or six and a half trips to the moon. Van Dyk comes in close second with 1,442,993 miles, or six trips to the moon.

Folk legend Bob Dylan and speed-guitar gods Metallica follow up with 1.4 and 1.3 million miles respectively. Aerosmith, Muse, the Rolling Stones, U2, Cyndi Lauper, and Snoop Dogg round out the top 10. Check the full list of details of the most traveled people via TravelBird.
