Houston (CBS HOUSTON) – The Houston Texans are hoping that the combination of JJ Watt and Jadeveon Clowney become a dynamic tandem of pass rushers for the team’s defense.

On Wednesday Watt was asked how it felt to have Clowney back from his most recent injury issue. JJ Watt answered the question and then went on to praise the guy who replaces Clowney when the former number one overall pick misses time.

“It’s good. I think Whitney (Mercilus) played a heck of a game,” Watt told reporters Wednesday. “You look at what Whitney did out there, he had 3.5 sacks. If you give him the one where he got the facemask penalty, it’s 4.5. The guy is playing great football, so you have to give him credit.”

Watt wasn’t asked about Whitney Mercilus during his media session, but praised the linebacker who was rewarded for a good season filling in for Clowney in 2014 with a new contract before the 2015 season before being moved around and used as a secondary outside linebacker to Clowney.

Was JJ trying to send a message to the coaches and Clowney or just praise a good performance by Mercilus?
