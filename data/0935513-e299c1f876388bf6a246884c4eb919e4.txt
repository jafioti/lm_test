FC Barcelona and the internet commercial giant Amazon are preparing the details of a sponsorship contract that would tie the two parties together in a four-year deal, from season 2017/18.

This is what 'As' newspaper report in their Sunday edition, in line with the information that SPORT has been providing since July 9, when we informed readers of the club's plans to close a deal for the first team shirt sponsors.

The Madrid-based publication states that Bar√ßa will have Qatar Airways on their shirts by their first pre-season friendly on July 30, against Celtic at Dublin's Aviva Stadium.

This coincides with SPORT's story on Saturday, which reported that the Catalan club and the airline would extend its commercial agreement for one year.

The executives of FC Barcelona and Amazon have been negotiating for months, and though the figures involved are being kept secret, the deal is not expected to reach the 65 million euros per season, plus incentives for titles, that Qatar Airways had been prepared to pay.
