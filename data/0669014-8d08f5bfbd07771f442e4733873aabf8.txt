Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) has reportedly trademarked 4 terms that could relate to its Project Morpheus virtual reality (VR) headset for the PlayStation 4 this week. The company has apparently filed for the phrases ‘Couch Multiplayer’, ‘Social Screen’, ‘Social VR’, and ‘Social Virtual Reality’ at the Japanese Patent Offices. Could these terms offer hints as to the company’s plans for its headset?

The filings were picked up by Trademark Bot on Twitter. The terms seem to relate back to the reveal of Project Morpheus at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March 2014, where SCE suggested that VR didn’t have to exclude multiplayer videogames. At the time it was noted that the device could potentially be used for second screen multiplayer similar to that of the Wii U.

With that in mind, the ‘Social Screen’ filing begins to make a bit more sense too. And it’s more than possible that ‘Couch Multiplayer’ also refers to this point. Interestingly enough each trademark is dated for 18th March 2014, just a day before Morpheus was revealed on 19th March. Could we see SCE expand on these terms with multiplayer VR titles at E3 2014 in June? VRFocus will be at the event to bring you all the latest on Project Morpheus and everything else VR.
