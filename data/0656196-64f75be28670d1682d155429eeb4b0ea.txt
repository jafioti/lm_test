He’s not David S. Pumpkins — he’s his own thing.

A Marine Parker says a popular “Saturday Night Live” skit has ruined his Halloween costume. Charles Mister was excited to show off the pumpkin-emblazoned suit his wife bought him for Halloween this year — but after Tom Hanks wore it on the sketch-comedy show’s absurdist “David Pumpkins” bit two weeks ago, it’s all anyone asks him about, he said.

“People are like ‘Are you pumpkin guy?’ and I’m like, ‘No, I don’t want to be,’ ” said Mr. Mister, a public-school music teacher. “I didn’t like the skit, I thought it was terrible. I don’t support that — I don’t support that pumpkin guy.”

His wife bought him the costume before the scene aired on Oct. 22, he said.

But the scene — in which a pumpkin-suited Tom Hanks and two skeleton b-boys are a haunted house’s least-scary attraction — has become wildly popular, and sales of the suit skyrocketed after it aired.

Either way, Mister is in good company — Hanks tweeted he’d be wearing the be-jack-o-lanternend ensemble on Halloween.

And good get-ups apparently run in Mister’s family — his son Kylen won “best costume” for his “headless boy” at the Marine Park Halloween festival on Oct. 29.

Here's the full skit:
