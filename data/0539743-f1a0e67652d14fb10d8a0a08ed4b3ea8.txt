Update: See answers to your questions about Lions here.

Lions, a new Boy Scouts of America pilot program for kindergarten boys, will begin in participating councils this fall.

Why go younger? Research shows that a child’s development accelerates at age 4 and 5 — about the time these youngsters begin their formal education in kindergarten. That’s also the time when families start looking for after-school activities for their children. While 5-year-olds could join a soccer team or karate studio, they couldn’t yet join Scouting.

That’s about to change in pilot councils across the country. Parents will welcome a program that introduces Scouting concepts and values to 5-year-olds in a fun, age-appropriate way.

The kindergarten-age boys themselves will enjoy exploring the world around them with friends. Lions promises to expand imaginations, spark creativity and amplify fun.

At the end of the Lion year, boys will graduate to Tiger and advance through Cub Scouting.

Lions will be piloted in select councils across the country. Your council’s Scout Executive already has details on how to apply to become a national pilot site for fall 2016.

Participating councils will share feedback with teams of volunteers and professionals for further study.

This is just the beginning of an exciting program sure to grow Scouting. I’ll share more details as I get them.
