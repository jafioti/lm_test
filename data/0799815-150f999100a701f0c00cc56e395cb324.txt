Friends and Neighbors,

Five years ago today, our community was rocked by the Clackamas Town Center shooting. I invite you to attend a gun violence prevention forum tomorrow, Tuesday, Dec. 12, in NW Portland. I encourage you to join me in honoring the victims of that tragic event.



Would you like to stay up to date on whatâ€™s going on in the Capitol? News and upcoming events are posted on my Facebook, Twitter, and Legislative webpage. I hope that you will continue to share ideas and priorities that I can bring to work with me in the Oregon Senate.

Hope to see you there,

Senator Ginny Burdick

Senate Majority Leader
