The Tampa Bay Lightning will host its annual celebration of local hockey on Saturday, Feb. 13 at Amalie Arena. With the Bolts organization putting more emphasis on community hockey this season, the event will feature many of the Lightning's community hockey initiatives, including the Lightning High School Hockey League All-Star Game, a sled hockey exhibition game featuring Lightning alumni and much more.

The event will begin with an open Lightning practice at 10:30 a.m. and will conclude with the championship game for the LHSHL. Below is a full list of events that fans can enjoy throughout the day.

There is a suggested $10 donation for entrance into the event. All of the proceeds will benefit the Lightning Made Sled Hockey program.

If it is anything like last year's event, the 2016 Hockey Day in Tampa Bay will be a fun time. I competed in last year's sled hockey exhibition along with Dave Andreychuk, Jassen Cullimore and other Lightning alumni, and I will do so again this year. Expect more information from the club in the coming days and don't forget to come out to Amalie Arena on Saturday.
