THE NRMA Insurance Broncos’ will once again be down on troops for the match with the Roosters in Sydney on Thursday after a double blow from the NRL video review committee.

The Broncos will today take early guilty pleas on charges against both Sam Thaiday and Josh McGuire out of Friday’s match against the Panthers.

That means the two State of Origin representatives will be missing for the game in Sydney.

It continues the bad run for the Broncos, who have not had their best team on the park for months now.

Thaiday can consider himself extremely unlucky to be suspended for what at first looked like a good tackle.

However the video review committee judged it to be a grade one dangerous throw, and with loading and carry-over points, Thaiday will miss a game.

If the Broncos – who historically have a poor success rate at the judiciary - were to fight the charge and lose, Thaiday would have received a two-match suspension.

That risk was deemed too great by club officials today, and the Broncos will not fight the charge.

McGuire will spend a match on the sideline for a dangerous contact charge, with carry-over points from a previous offence contributing to his suspension.

The Broncos will name replacements for the representative pair tomorrow, with some hope Queensland second rower Matt Gillett will return from a shoulder injury.

Gillett has not played since hurting his joint in the final Origin match.

STAY STRONG. STAY TRUE. BE PART OF OUR FINALS FIGHTBACK!
