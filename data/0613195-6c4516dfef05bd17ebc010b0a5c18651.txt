After months and months of promo between NBA games and post-Playoff game press conferences, the day finally arrived for The Doctor, NBAtv’s much-anticipated documentary about basketball hall-of-famer legend Julius “Dr. J” Erving to air. NBAtv premiered the special last Tuesday, and now you can experience it for yourself on this Father’s Day.

Dr. J is most known for the blown-out afro he rocked in the 1970s and ’80s, the cool image he projected in public and for his seemingly gravity-defying dunking abilities. Narrated by emcee Chuck D of Public Enemy, The Doctor provides just enough footage of some of Erving’s classic “shock, wow, and awe” moments on the court, with cameos from George Gervin, Magic Johnson, Bob Costas, and even Bill Walton, amongst others, to delight the die-hard basketball fan. But the documentary also presents viewers with an alternative, at times heart-wrenching image of Julius Erving – as little brother, family man, father, and ultimately, as a humble human being who was as much the epitome of class as he was of swagger.
