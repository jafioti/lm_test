Find errors early when they are less expensive to fix. Intel® Inspector is an easy-to-use memory and threading error debugger for C, C++, and Fortran applications that run on Windows* and Linux*. The 2019 version includes a persistence inspector to find errors using persistent memory, such as missing or redundant cache flushes. No special compilers or builds are required. Just use a normal debug or production build. Use the graphical user interface or automate regression testing with the command line. It has a stand-alone user interface on Windows and Linux or it can be integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio*. Enhance productivity, cut costs, and speed time-to-market.

Intel Inspector is available as part of Intel® Parallel Studio XE and Intel® System Studio (includes options for free and purchased licenses). A license purchase includes Priority Support. If you qualify for Intel's student or academic programs, these toolkits may be available in free or discounted versions.
