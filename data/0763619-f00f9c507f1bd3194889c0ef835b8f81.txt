Acton Beale (pictured), 20, plunged seven storeys to his death from an inner-city Brisbane apartment block in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Police have confirmed that Beale was planking – the internet photo viral craze that has swept Australia – when he fell.

Police said alcohol was involved, warning of the dangers of the fad where people are photographed lying face down in unusual public spaces.

Prime Minister Julia Gillard described the incident as "really tragic".

"There’s a difference between a harmless bit of fun done somewhere that’s really safe and taking a risk with your life," she told reporters in Sydney.

"Everybody likes a bit of fun, but focus has to be on keeping yourself safe first."
