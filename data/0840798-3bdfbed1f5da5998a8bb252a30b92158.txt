…as you all know. And yet, there is this: I support Barack Obama and so should you.

So many people have already written and spoken about him far more eloquently than I could hope to do myself, so I won’t talk about his integrity, his inspiring message, his real commitment to change. Because here is the thing that matters to us here in this little circle of monkey-, robot- and mad-scientist-lovers: he a geek’s candidate. If you understand why network neutrality is important, if you can imagine how transparency and connectivity might improve our Democracy, if you think it’s sort of important that the people who run this country know something about computers and the internet, then you have no business backing anybody else. Obama understands these issues in the way that geeks understand them.

If you are not convinced by all the intelligent and forward thinking people around the internet who are also Obama fans (John Hodgman, David Rees of Get Your War On, Randall Munroe of xkcd, Andy Baio of Waxy.org, Lawrence Lessig of Lawrence Lessig, I could go on and on), then I must deploy the superweapon.

Do as I say: vote for Obama.
