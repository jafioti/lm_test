And we're back in business! Slowly but surely, the amount of news is rising back up to the top, and what better way than to keep everyone jumping up than with some new tunes to get those ears excited for the things to come?

Composer Takeharu Ishimoto has uploaded yet another demo onto Soundcloud! This track may be familiar to you, especially if you had the chance to watch The World Ends With You 5th Anniversary LIVE -Crossover-! SAWA, well known for her contributions to the soundtrack in the original game on the Nintendo DS, performs none other than TWISTER! It's just like if you were back in O-WEST, watching the Death March rock it out onstage, so check it out!
