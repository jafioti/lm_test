Got a great selection of gifts from my gifter, plus a hand drawn reddit alien and a message from them.

Got a packet of Haribo, because who doesn't love haribo.

Got 'Feed' by Mira Grant, a book I have wanted to read for a while and something that has been on my amazon wishlist for ages. Can't wait to start it.

I also got a cute Android Cat Collectible which I love! I am a long time Android user, and I also want to get a cat soon so this can fill the gap until then.

I love the Walking Dead video game and tv series, and anybody who watches TWD knows how awesome Daryl is. I also got a Vinyl Figure of Daryl complete with crossbow!

So happy with my presents, my gifter really stalked me well and is extremely generous! Thank you so much.
