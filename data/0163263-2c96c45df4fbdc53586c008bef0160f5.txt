Insulation firm pleads guilty after installer's death

Updated

The employers of a teenage insulation installer who was electrocuted in central Queensland have pleaded guilty to breaching safety laws.

Rueben Barnes, 16, died while installing fibreglass insulation in the ceiling of a house at Stanwell, west of Rockhampton, in November last year.

The teenager's death was one of four linked to the Federal Government's failed home insulation scheme that was scrapped in February.

Richard and Christopher Jackson from Arrow Property Maintenance appeared in the Rockhampton Magistrates Court this afternoon charged with breaching the Electrical Safety Authority Act and the Workplace Health and Safety Act.

The court heard a pre-existing defect in the wiring of the house and the failure of the company to ensure a safe workplace caused the teenager's death.

Defence lawyer Cam Schroder said his clients were deeply distressed by the accident.

Industrial Magistrate John McGrath has reserved his judgment until Friday.

The maximum fine for breaches of the Electrical Safety Act causing a death is $500,000.
