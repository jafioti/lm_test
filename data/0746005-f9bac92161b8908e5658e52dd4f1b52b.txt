Rudd flags credit market rescue package

Updated

The Federal Government is considering a financial support package for the credit market, as the crunch continues to hit banks hard.

Some foreign banks are scaling back their lending to markets such as Australia because the cost of banks' borrowing is still very high.

That could see Australian businesses unable to refinance $75 billion worth of loans with foreign banks.

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says the Government is prepared help out because confidence in the banking sector is crucial for economic stability.

"The Australian Government has already developed a special purpose vehicle for the car finance industry to support dealerships as their foreign-owned financiers left Australia," he said.

"We will continue to work with and in partnership with the private sector to do what we can to support Australian credit markets."

While Australian banks are generally considered to be in a strong position, Mr Rudd has described the state of the markets as frightening.

"If foreign banks do not roll over their share of these loans, it would be difficult for Australia's four major banks to fill the gap on their own," he said.

"If banks do not allow clients to refinance as they would in normal conditions, then companies can be forced to sell assets, often at a low price."

He said that would endanger the health of the whole economy.
