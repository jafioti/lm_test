If one woman symbolizes International Women's Day for Americans, and black American women in particular, it's Michelle Obama, the successful career-woman and mother of two who became First Lady.



Michelle LaVaughn Obama n√©e Robinson (born January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and the wife of Barack Obama, President-elect of the United States. She will be the first African-American to become the First Lady of the United States.

She was born and grew up on the South Side of Chicago and graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School.



After completing her formal education, she returned to Chicago and accepted a position with the law firm Sidley Austin, and subsequently worked as part of the staff of Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley, and for the University of Chicago Medical Center.
