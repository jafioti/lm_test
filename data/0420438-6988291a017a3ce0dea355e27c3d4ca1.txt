Hello and welcome to my little slice of the internet.

A little bit about me; I am a dragon'kin and have identified as such for about 9 years now. As a PhD candidate I tend to drift on-and-off the online community depending on my work flow and social commitments, but I'll try to stay semi-active here on my blog.

As a disclaimer of sorts I'll make it clear now that anything that I say on here should only ever be taken as my personal opinion. Just because i've been around for a while doesn't give me any authority on otherkinity and my opinion is pretty much as valid as anyone else's. However, I will always try to be good-mannered and respectful, and I ask the same of my readers.

I'll tend to post my thoughts and musings as and when I can. Feel free to ask me anything, or to comment on my ramblings, but don't be offended if I don't reply to you; I can be a rather busy person depending on my RL commitments.

That's pretty much all you need to know about me and this blog.

Enjoy! =3
