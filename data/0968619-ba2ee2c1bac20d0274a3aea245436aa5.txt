Russia: Look at Me

The photographs in the “Looks” section of Look at Me are sent in from all over Russia. “Street style in Russia has radically changed over the past ten years,” Daria Zhemchug, the site’s fashion editor, told me. “More and more young people have an opportunity to travel and study abroad and begin to look like their peers from other countries, especially in Moscow and St. Petersburg. They are not afraid to wear vintage clothes and know such brands as Supreme, even when they are not represented in Russia. I can’t say that a person in Moscow will look really different from person in Berlin if they have the same social status. People still shy away from wearing bright colors and perhaps wear more fur coats then in any other country in the world. But I don’t think it’s all because of our Soviet past. It’s really cold and really dirty most of the year.”
