The Diamondback is the award-winning independent student newspaper of the University of Maryland, College Park. It was founded in 1910 as The Triangle and renamed in 1921 in honor of a local reptile, the Diamondback terrapin (the terrapin became the official school mascot in 1933). The print edition of the newspaper is published once a week on Monday, with a print circulation of 8,000,[1] down from a high of more than 21,000, and what used to be annual advertising revenues of more than $1 million. It is usually twelve to sixteen pages.[2] The Diamondback publishes a daily digital edition during the school year which can be found at dbknews.com.

The paper's current independent status was originally intended as punishmentâ€”the Board of Regents cut off student funding after The Diamondback's actions in 1971, when it ran two pages blank in protest of campus censorship and placed tombstones on its editorial page in protest of the Vietnam War.[3]

The paper's offices are located on the third floor of the South Campus Dining Hall, across from the WMUC-FM radio station and the University of Maryland's Residence Hall Association office. [4]
