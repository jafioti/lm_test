Originally designed as guest house for esteemed scientific visitors of the PAL.A.D.IN, this beach house has been built into a streak of lava rocks approximately 300 meters from the main complex.

Situated directly on the black sand beach, the three story house is connected by a fully roofed and window walled walkway with the garage/entrance wing on a slightly elevated rock formation, which also serves as foundation for the private access driveway.

Infinity pool, sun deck and the open architecture convinced Dr. Draxler, the chief archeologist of PAL.A.D.IN to seize the place as her own when she was looking for accomodation in convenient vicinity to her working place.

So now she owns the fashionable place and enjoys the open office on the top floor as well as all the spacious opportunities to put her favorite relics or replicated pieces along with her beloved airplane models and the hydraulic flight simulator.
