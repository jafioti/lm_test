I stopped in my local Gamestop yesterday to pickup Madden 13 and ended up leaving with a Nexus 7 too lol. Ill be giving this one to my gf but I just wanted to post a few pics of some things that may be slightly different about the C80 production runs. I didnt do a complete teardown of the unit so I cant say if any changes have been made to combat the over exaggerated screen lift stuff but I have noticed a few small changes. I honestly dont think anything has really changed in terms of manufacturing but these units had just came in yesterday morning so im assuming it was a fresh batch.First up is the box. Im not sure when they made this change but my C70 didnt have the notches on the box for easy opening. I remember kinda having a hard time separating the box when I first got my C70.Second thing I noticed was the C80 units have a few screws missing. Im not sure if this is something they just started doing, but I exchanged three C80 units at Gamestop yesterday because me and the manager thought it was a flaw but all 3 random units had the two missing screws.Here are a few shots of the back cover and unit. Im not sure if anything is different but maybe someone whos more familiar with the insides may notice something.I did noticed the serial # on the rear sticker is now printed in white as opposed to black:
