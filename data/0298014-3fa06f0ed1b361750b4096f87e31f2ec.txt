Community

Berkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood will be hosting a series of four Community Forums over the summer and into early September. The first Community Forum will be in West Berkeley on July 17, 2017 from 6:00pm to 9:00pm at the Berkeley Adult School (1701 San Pablo Avenue). The remaining three meetings will be in other parts of the city.



"These community forums will give us the opportunity to converse with our community; to hear our community's perspective on what we're doing well, where we can improve, and what priorities and concerns our community members have for our Department." said Chief Greenwood. "While these meetings will take place in different parts of the City, but anyone may attend any of the meetings, all are invited."



The forums will be structured to give attendees an opportunity to engage with Officers, Detectives and Professional Staff from throughout the department, including the Chief and Command Staff, Detectives, Dispatchers, Area Coordinators, Beat Officers, Special Response Team members, Personnel and Training, Motor Officers and Parking Enforcement Officers.



These meetings come as the result of Chief Greenwood’s commitment to proactively seek community feedback to inform the Department's planning for the future, and to focus on enhancing trust and understanding between the community and its police department.

In addition to the July date, please mark your calendars for our future forums. The locations have yet to be determined but those dates and times are:

August 8, 2017, from 6:00pm to 9:00pm (location TBD – North Berkeley)
