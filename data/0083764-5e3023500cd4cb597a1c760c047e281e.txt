512 pages, 7 countries, 100s of free & near-free life-changing volunteer adventures

Whether you want to spend your days caring for orphans, distributing HIV medicine, nursing baby monkeys, or reforesting mangroves, there is a volunteer opportunity for you in Central America. We know because we spent months crisscrossing all seven countries searching for free and near-free volunteer opportunities. And boy did we find them! Now, we're coming to you to help us share them!

Barefoot Atlas: Volunteer Central America is the very first guidebook of its kind. We wrote it for extraordinary people in search of both adventure and meaning. So in addition to the location descriptions, maps, and travel information you find in most travel guides, Volunteer Central America profiles hundreds of volunteer opportunities in exhaustive detail. Readers can compare all the opportunities out there and find the one that’s perfect for them — where they'll be happiest and where they'll have the biggest impact. All the opportunities we describe are free or near-free and are with local organizations, not big international agencies. They focus on a wide range of issues including education, health, the environment, children, agriculture, women, the arts, and much more. Best of all, they range from one day to one year so everyone, regardless of how much time they have to give, can find a way to help.

WHAT THE FUNDS ARE FOR

We've spent a year making Volunteer Central America the absolute best we can make it. Now, we're coming to the Kickstarter community to raise money so we can put it into print. The way we see it, every copy we print has the potential to send someone on a life-changing journey and bring about positive change where it’s needed most.
