Hemp is a cannabis plant that can repair the gap in the ozone layer in less than 20 years. It sucks in truck loads of CO2. That's important if we are to stop global warming... And if we don't stop it in the next decade, scientists predict an ice age to occur. That can't be good. ^_^'



About a century ago, the US made the growth of hemp illegal. Hemp is a very useful plant that can create medicines, supplements items, and more. Hemp also released ozone --- a chemical that is vital for putting a stop on global warming. Ozone breathes in the CO2 and releases oxygen, and so hemp can be very useful, especially because the US has the most CO2 emissions out of every country in the world.



Hemp can also produce thousands of jobs, and improve our economy by a billion.



Please don't get hemp confused with marijuana. Hemp has little to none THC in it, and cannot get you high. I'm thinking, after I get the required number of signatures needed to pass this bill, I will send a letter to congress about it. Farmers will need permits in order to grow hemp, and once their growing it --- then yay, mission accomplished!



I urge you to please sign the petition, so you can take a small step for man and so the United States can take a leap for mankind. :)
