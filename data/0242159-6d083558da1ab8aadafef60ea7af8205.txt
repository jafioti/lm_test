Easter Jeep Safari

Each year, Jeep creates and unveils some crazy concepts for the Easter Jeep Safari in Moab, Utah. However, this year's concepts might take the cake. That's because, along with six other truly inspired 4x4s, Jeep has debuted a Wrangler with a 707-horsepower V8 engine.

It's called the Jeep Trailcat. In creating the Trailcat, Jeep designers did more than wedge a 6.2-liter supercharged "Hellcat" V8 under its bright green hood. First, they extended the wheel base of the Wrangler by 12 inches and then chopped the windshield height by two inches, giving it a distinctive stance.

Jeep finished off the Trailcat by slathering it in bright green paint and bolted up 17-inch wheels, a satin-black grille and sport bucket seats from the Dodge Viper.

Of course, that's just the start of the Jeep concepts. The iconic American 4x4 maker also created a pickup truck version of the Renegade called the Renegade Commander.

Continuing the pickup truck theme, Jeep also pulled the covers off a salute to Jeep's military service vehicles called the Crew Chief 715 as well as a cab-over retro-inspired concept called FC 150.

Rounding out the concepts is one more final nod to Jeep's retro designs called the Jeep Shortcut, which, as Jeep puts it, is a "carefully crafted take on the beloved Jeep CJ-5, this Wrangler-based concept vehicle invokes the spirit of 1950s Americana with a shortened body and functional simplicity."

For as much as I love these concepts, they mostly just make me sad. That's because I'd immediately shell out all my hard-earned bucks for a truck like the Shortcut. Unfortunately, Jeep likely will never build a production version of such a wondrous retro machine.
