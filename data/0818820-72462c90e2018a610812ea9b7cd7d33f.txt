Drummond has not shown improvement at the free-throw line. Last season, he shot only .389, the worst figure in the league, even worse than the notoriously bad free-throw shooter (and excellent rebounder) DeAndre Jordan (. 397). This season, Drummond is about the same, .393. Other star big men have struggled at the line in their careers, but Chamberlain had only one season under .400 and Shaquille O’Neal never had one.

After a year at Connecticut, the 6-foot-11 Drummond was selected ninth over all by the Pistons in 2012. He came off the bench as a rookie, then became a starter for Detroit and has emerged as the star of his class, along with Anthony Davis and Damian Lillard.

Despite his improvement this season, Drummond will not be recognized as a superstar until the Pistons get better. The Drummond era includes 29-, 29- and 32-win seasons so far.

One key could be Stan Van Gundy, who is entering his second season as Detroit’s coach.

Van Gundy became coach of the Orlando Magic in Howard’s fourth season, his breakout year. Van Gundy built a system with an athletic center on both ends of the court, and Howard went from good to great.

Van Gundy has rebuilt the Pistons in a similar image, acquiring the scoring point guard Reggie Jackson to play the pick-and-roll with Drummond and letting center Greg Monroe go to the Bucks as a free agent, opening up many more rebounding opportunities.

The retooled Pistons are 5-3, with wins over the Hawks and the Bulls. In the weaker Eastern Conference, the playoffs could be a realistic goal. Jackson is scoring, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope continues to develop and Marcus Morris looks like a good acquisition. But Drummond and his hunger for rebounds will be the key.
