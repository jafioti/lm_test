With Marcos Senna retiring at season’s end and Raul contemplating his future, the New York Cosmos could be left to fill two important and high profile roster spots for the 2016 NASL campaign.

Last week, EoS reported the club’s chase for former Lazio midfielder Cristian Ledesma and Palermo striker Enzo Maresca — a sign of their intent at filling Senna’s position.

This week, it is a target striker that enters the conversation.

According to several reports out of Italy, former Celtic striker and longtime Greek National Team player Georgios Samaras is talking to the Cosmos about a possible move to the NASL.

Samaras, 30, recently rejected an offer from Turkish club Bursaspor and is rumored to be talking to Italian outfit Sampdoria about a possible move as well. In fact, several reports cite Sampdoria as the front runner for his signature, with the Cosmos giving a chase as well. The Greek striker, who has 81 caps and nine goals with the national team, is currently a free agent after ending his association with West Brom. He last appeared on loan for Al-Hilal of the Saudi Premier League last season, scoring a single goal and adding two assists in nine matches across all competitions.

Samaras carries with him a hefty salary, rumored to be around the $2 million/year range; quite a sum if the Cosmos are truly contending for the striker’s services.

EoS could not confirm the veracity of this report at the time of publishing. We reached out to the Cosmos who issued “no comment” on the rumors.
