New Jersey drivers pay the fifth-highest share of the cost to fund roads and bridges, with motorists kicking in 67 percent of the price tag through taxes and tolls, according to a study.

New Jersey ranks behind only Hawaii, Delaware, New York and Florida of states where local revenues pay a majority of road costs, according to a Tax Foundation study. The tax research foundation's authors considered taxes, fees and tolls dedicated to transportation in the study.

Alaska drivers pay the least in the country, only 12 percent, followed by North and South Dakota at 22 percent and 25 percent, respectively.

An analysis by CityLab said those states rely heavily on federal funding for road and bridge work to make up the difference. They also said the study reinforces the point that roads are not "free," even if drivers don't pay a toll.

The study is based on 2014 federal and state data, so it doesn't capture last November's 23 cent per gallon state motor fuel tax increase to fund the Transportation Trust Fund. But the report says states should fund infrastructure with "user taxes and other fees as much as possible."
