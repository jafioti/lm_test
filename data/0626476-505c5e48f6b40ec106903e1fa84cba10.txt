DETROIT, MI -- Police say a man entered a church during a service in Detroit about 1:45 p.m. Sunday threatening the congregation with a brick.

The pastor pulled out a gun inside Church of God Ministries and shot the man multiple times. He later died at the hospital.

The Detroit News is reporting on a possible love triangle involving the pastor, victim and victim's wife.

"Officers responded to 2200 Grand River for a shooting that just happened; once inside, the officers observed a 25-year-old male victim suffering from multiple gunshot wounds," Detroit Police Officer Daniel Danikowski told MLive. "The suspect, a 36-year-old male who was the pastor, was still present at the scene.

"The suspect stated that the (intruder) had harassed him on multiple occasions in the past. According to the suspect, the victim attempted to attack him with a brick, at which time he produced the firearm."

The shooter was questioned and released Sunday, according to Danikowski. The case is being turned over to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office for a review of possible charges.

Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt told The News the victim and pastor had a history of problems.

"He had been threatening him to do bodily harm," Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt told The Detroit News. "He walked into the service and went after the pastor with a brick. The pastor pulled out his Glock and fired several shots. I think he hit him four or five times, and the man died."

The shooting comes months after a June 17 racially-motivated mass shooting inside a Charleston, South Carolina, church that killed nine people.
