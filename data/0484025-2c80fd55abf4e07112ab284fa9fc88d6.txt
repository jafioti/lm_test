The Faygo Beverages Inc. company announced Monday the will offer their popular Rock & Rye drink in Slurpee form at 7-Eleven stores in Michigan and Ohio.

The Detroit-based Faygo company announced in a Tweet that “The people have spoken” and the drink will be available at stores. The spiced, vanilla cream flavor joins Redpop, the iconic strawberry soda and flagship flavor of the company.

Faygo Beverages and 7-Eleven started selling Redpop Slurpees at about 300 Michigan and Ohio stores in March. In May of last year, local 7-Eleven stores unveiled the Vernors Slurpee, featuring the flavor of another iconic Detroit-created soft drink. Vernors was created in 1866 by James Vernor in a downtown Detroit pharmacy.

Metro Detroiters have a thirst for 7-Eleven Slurpees. Customers in the Metro Detroit region consume more Slurpees than in any other market in the nation, 7-Eleven officials said.

The Dallas-based company introduced the Slurpee in 1966 and now sells more than 13 million a month.

Faygo started in Detroit 1907 as the Feigenson Brothers Bottling Work, founded by two brothers who were originally bakers in Russia.
