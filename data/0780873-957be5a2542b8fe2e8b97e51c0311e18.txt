MailOnline was invited to join the tour too, which started off by entering the village of Hosmeade before moving on to some the iconic locations made famous by the popular movie series.

This included the Hogwarts castle itself, to the Three Broomsticks pub, the family run Weasley Wizard Wheezes joke shop and Honey Duke's sweet shop.

'I've basically built a film set,' Alan Gilmore, the brain behind the aesthetics of the park and Art Director on several of the films, told MailOnline. 'I believe you could film scenes here if you wanted.'
