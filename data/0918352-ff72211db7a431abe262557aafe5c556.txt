Following on from last week’s Doctor Who info-graphic, we’re back with 18 humorous observations that can help you decide whether or not your Sherlock obsession has gone too far…

Sherlockians are used to long waits, but eight long months since “The Reichenbach Fall” toyed with our emotions back in January. Series 3 still feels as far away as ever. Last week, co-creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss revealed three words that would be crucial to the great detective’s third outing. They were rat, wedding and bow. These revelations sent shock waves of surprise and speculation through the fandom (you can read our speculation and analysis here), but in the cold light of day we’re still at least one year away from another batch of three cases – and essentially none the wiser.

Keep your chins up though! Hypable is here to quell your Sherlock woes and help you remember what it is you love about the show. We hope you’ll find our observations humorous, fan-centric and in some cases accurate (though we’re not expecting many of you to have arch-enemies, as in the words of John Watson, “there are no arch-enemies in real life”). If you have anything else to add to the list, please share it with the rest of us in the comments because we’d love to hear from you!

Before this introduction becomes longer than one of Sherlock’s deductions, here it is!

Sherlock resumes filming early in 2013, with a broadcast date being eyed for later that year (co-composer David G. Arnold recently revealed he would be scoring the series next summer). Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman will both return for the three episodes, penned by Steven Moffat, Mark Gatiss and Steve Thompson.
