A CYCLIST has completed an epic journey of more than 11,000 miles from Hampshire to Hong Kong.

Robert Miller pedalled his way across the world for more than 14 months, raising money for Oakhaven Hospice at Lymington.

His journey started in July 2014, when he left the village of Hordle near Lymington, travelling on his trusty touring bike to Istanbul.

He then flew from Istanbul to India, travelling through countries including Nepal, north east India, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos before he arrived in Hong Kong.

He slept in monasteries and people’s homes as well as camping.

Robert, 38, even cycled back to Lymington from Heathrow after his flight home.

He said: “I’ve always enjoyed travelling and seeing new people and places. This was real travel.

You got to see things most people would never experience.

“People welcomed me with open arms and everyone has been so nice and helpful.”
