Creature Comforts Koko Buni, the brewery’s coveted milk porter, returns to cans again in mid-December.

One of the first seasonals by the Athens, Georgia based brewery, Creature Comforts Koko Buni is a milk porter, aged on toasted coconut and cocoa nibs Condor Chocolates and coffee from nearby 1000 Faces. This late fall season has been overwhelmingly popular since its debut a few years ago. We’ve seen fistfights over Koko cans at retailers.

2018 is the first production run after the brewery brought their new production facility online, so fans should expect a little more “Buni” to go around this year.

“We decided not to be traditional with the beer and add some ingredients that play well with the already roasty and chocolatey flavors of darker beers.” -Co-Founder and Head Brewer David Stein.

Coffee lovers will find a home here. Koko Buni starts heavy on the 1000 Faces coffee, and turns chocolatey mid-sip, finishing with a wisp of coconut.

Creature Comforts Koko Buni will be a seasonal draft and 12-ounce can offering, available at the brewery and Georgia retailers again in mid-December, 2018.
