LONGMEADOW â€” A member of Longmeadow's Select Board submitted three proposed gun control bylaws for the May 10 Town Meeting warrant as citizen petitions.

Select Board member Alex Grant was the lead petitioner, and submitted the petitions as a town resident, rather than in his capacity as a member of the board, Chairman Richard Foster said. Citizen petitions bypass Select Board approval, and go straight onto the warrant for Town Meeting consideration.

When a resident brought up the warrant articles at a select board meeting last week, Grant said that he believes they will spark a healthy discussion.

"I'm looking forward to a nice debate on these issues," Grant said. "As long as we're respectful, it's going to be valuable for our democracy."

The first of the gun control warrant articles calls for a $300 fine to be imposed on anyone who possesses a firearm, rifle or shotgun in town-owned buildings or on recreation property. The second would require gun owners to provide the police department with descriptions (including the serial number, make, model, and caliber) of each firearm, rifle, or shotgun they own. A third proposed bylaw would ban assault weapons in Longmeadow, and impose a $300 per day fine on people who own them within the town.

Since the measures were introduced to the Town Meeting warrant as citizen petitions, the Select Board has not discussed them in open session or executive session, Foster said.

"This issue has never been brought before the board," Foster said. "So it's never been a board discussion formally or informally."
