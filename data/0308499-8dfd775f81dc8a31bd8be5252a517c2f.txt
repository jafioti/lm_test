This adventure was written before I had a chance to read through Volo's Guide to Monsters and therefore does not contain any of the context written in that book. I may at some point add it in but it won't be any time soon.

This module contains background information, referee’s notes, and a complete map. PALACE OF THE VIPER is from the Just Because(”J”) series; like others in the series, it is meant to stand on its own and is a complete 5TH EDITION DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure. The recommended number of players are four to five, with levels ranging from eighth to tenth.

Palace of the Viper puts the players into one of four mission within the deadly Palace of Merrshaulk.

1. Stop the deadly Yuan-Ti from awakening their god Merrshaulk.

2. Reclaim the Rod of Resurrection for the fabled Deseret Bandits of Farea.

3. Save the High Priestess of Lathander from being sacrificed.

4. Escape the deadly clutches of the Yuan-Ti.

- Inside the players will find a variety of deadly traps, exciting combat encounters, brain testing puzzles, and enticing role playing situations.

- This adventure requires the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual to play.

- Within this adventure, the players have the chance of facing off against the Hebipoulpe, a monstrosity of a woman, snake, and octopus, and the Torischlange, a huge bird with the head of a cobra.

- A print friendly version is included.

- Player maps for those who want them. The player maps don't show secret chambers, room numbers, corridor letters, colored corridor lines, and slight map changes. Dungeon Masters should be aware of these map differences.
