DEV Q&A

Will you offer the "Shark" T7 Combat Car to other players as well?

We'll have to think up something fun to tie into it. Suggestions are always welcome.

Will we ever have large scale matches (30vs30 on dedicated maps)?

We've been playing it on PC in the test, and it's really interesting. We'll have to evaluate the possibility of supporting it once we upgrade to the version of the server that has it.

When will the Update 3.8 audio issues be fixed?

We're trying to do a mid-version patch for audio but it was too complex. Fixes will be applied in Update 3.9 which is currently in testing.

Will we see functioning lights on tanks?

We've tested that out already and got it working, but we're not that happy with the results of 60 lights bouncing around, and there were performance implications if the tanks got too close to each other. It's something we hope to revisit one day.
