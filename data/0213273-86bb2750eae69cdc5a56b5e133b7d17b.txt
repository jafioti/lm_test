Is there still a chance for Constantine? NBC decided to not order any more episodes this season beyond the initial 13, but were also quick to indicate the show had not been cancelled yet and that that determination was still to be made, depending on how the remaining Season 1 episodes perform.

At the TCA (Television Critics Association) press tour today, I asked NBC president Jennifer Salke and chairman Robert Greenblatt about Constantine’s performance and its chances.

Said Salke, “We wish the show had done better live. It has a big viewership after [it airs] in all kinds of ways and it has a younger audience, but the live number is challenging. It hasn't come out in the way we wanted it to, but we love the show. I think it's fair to say we're still talking about it.”

Added Greenblatt, “We got on the bandwagon of these shows based on comic books and maybe there are too many of them. It's a popular series of comics, but it's not The Flash, it's not Batman. So maybe it suffers a little bit there. But as Jen said, it's a show we really like. We love Matt Ryan, who's the star of it. I think we did right by the fans who didn't like the film that was made of it. The future is still up in the air for that show.”

Constantine returns tonight to kick off the remaining five episodes of Season 1. NBC is moving the show up to hours to 8:00pm ET/PT, which indicates they do want to see how the show could do in different (and most would argue better) timeslot.
