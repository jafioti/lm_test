Bill O’Reilly will conduct a sit-down interview with President Donald Trump that will air during the FOX broadcast network's Super Bowl LI pregame show on Sunday at 4:00 p.m. ET.

The interview will take place at the White House and cover an array of topics.

This will mark O’Reilly’s first interview with President Trump, having interviewed him multiple times as a candidate throughout the course of the election season.

"The Factor" host sat down with President Barack Obama before the Super Bowls on FOX in 2011 and 2014. The latter sit-down made lots of headlines as O'Reilly pressed the president on Benghazi and the IRS scandal.

O'Reilly said he'll delve into a number of "policy questions" with the 45th President, but also ask Trump how he feels about ascending to the highest position in the world with no political experience.

"It should be a very interesting conversation and I really appreciate FNC's confidence in me," said O'Reilly.

Additional portions of the interview will be presented on "The O’Reilly Factor" on Monday, February 6, at 8:00pm ET.
