SEATTLE - A HomeStreet Bank worker accused of stealing $78,000 out of the vault of a bank branch in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood faces a theft charge.



King County prosecutors claim Dararath Mok stole the money after closing down the bank on Christmas Eve. Another employee arrived two days later to find the cash gone.



According to charging papers, Mok, a 35-year-old Federal Way man, told police he stole the money to pay his family's medical bills. Police say he then admitted to gambling away more than $4,000 at a casino following the heist.



Writing the court, a Seattle detective said Mok was caught on surveillance camera crawling through the bank to the vault. The detective said Mok then disabled the alarm and smashed the control panel, stuck tape over the vault room camera lens and opened the vault.



Mok was quickly identified as a suspect in the theft. The burglar used his alarm code to enter the vault, and he initially told police he'd forgotten to lock the door the burglar used to break in.



Arrested on Dec. 29 after arriving for work, Mok soon admitted to stealing the money, the detective said.



Mok "was extremely cooperative and remorseful about his actions with detectives," the detective said in charging papers. "He stated that he felt like he had financial difficulties in his life that were overwhelming him. He cried several times and apologized for his actions."



Later that day, police seized a box of money from Mok's home, as well as a Muckleshoot Casino club card. Detectives recovered $44,494 - $33,500 less than Mok is alleged to have stolen.



Mok has been charged with first-degree theft. He has not been jailed.
