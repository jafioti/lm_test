Usain Bolt has rocketed into the history books with victory in the 200 metre final in Rio.

It was a phenomenal performance during which Bolt never looked threatened.

It was Bolt’s eighth Olympic Gold Medal.

The Lightning Bolt wasn’t fully satisfied with his 19.79 performance- appearing annoyed after he crossed the line.

Yet he should be proud having left his opponents for dead.

Veteran Aussie commentator Bruce McAvaney declared that seeing Bolt’s victory

“Felt like being kissed by a ray of sunshine.”

When asked what he was most proud of the Jamaican legend responded by saying

“Coming back from injury”

“I keep telling these young one’s I have never seen you guys beat me. It’s not going to happen”

Massive congrats to Usain who has cemented himself as one of athletic’s great immortals.

Can he make even more history by leading Jamaica to 4 x 100 m glory on Saturday morning?

We (and Bruce) cannot wait.
