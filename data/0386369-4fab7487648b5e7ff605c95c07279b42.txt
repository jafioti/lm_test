The Swiss preselection has only been open for 9 days and we already have a prominent name: Jessica Sutta from the Pussycat Dolls! The famous girlband split up in 2010 – since then Jessica Sutta has been pursuing her solo career as a Pop/Dance artist. She joined the band in 2002 and was therefore involved in major hits such as Don’t Cha or Buttons

Jessica Sutta’s entry for the Swiss National Final is called Candy. The single was only released today and immediately uploaded to the SRF online platform as well.

You may ask yourself why an American singer is trying to compete in the Swiss national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. Switzerland currently has no nationality-related rules in their preselection which means artists from all over the world are welcome to submit a song. Switzerland already has quite a history of sending foreign acts to Eurovision – most prominently the Canadian star Céline Dion in 1988 or the Estonian band Vanilla Ninja in 2005. Bearing that in mind, an American competing for Switzerland wouldn’t exactly come as a huge surprise.
