You know the saying, “the market is never wrong.” Well, that’s wrong. It’s wrong all the time.

It was wrong when yield-hungry fixed income investors were buying up garbage slice-and-dice subprime CDOs. And it’s wrong today.

With the 10-year Treasury now yielding less than 3%, the largest, most liquid debt market in the world, the U.S. government bond market is wrong.

Of course, “wrong” is a loaded term. So let’s just say that buyers of U.S. government paper are accepting a yield that in time will turn out to be inadequate for the relative risk they are taking.

Oh, I know the arguments. There’s no risk. U.S. government Triple-A paper is the “safety trade”. It’s the place investors run to when they’re scared the world is falling apart. And lately, the world’s been falling apart everyday.

But no risk in U.S. Treasurys? Please….
