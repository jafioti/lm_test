The Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety evacuated its headquarters after a citizen brought ammunition and grenades into the station’s lobby for disposal.

Local 911 services are in the process of being transferred to Santa Clara County communications, department officials reported in a tweet. The incident occurred shortly before 12:30 p.m.

The Santa Clara County Sheriff’s bomb squad arrived at about 1:30 p.m. to clear the building until weapons could be declared safe. By about 2:20 p.m., the bomb squad had removed the ammunition and grenades from the headquarters and were taking x-rays to determine whether the objects were inert, said Capt. Shawn Ahearn Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety.

“They’re in the process of developing the x-rays,” Ahearn said, adding that the squad was in the front parking lot of the police headquarters examining the objects.

The department said its headquarters will be closed for an unknown amount of time and is asking people to stay away from the area.

The citizen, who was not identified, found the ammunition and grenade in their garage, Ahearn said.
