UPDATE: August 4 at 4:55 p.m. ET

A week has now passed since our original post, and just a couple things were revealed. First, Way revealed the lyrics of a new song titled “Millions” and Sydney Opera House announced that he and Grant Morrison would be participating in a convesation Graphic 2013 where they are expected to “reveal their biggest collaboration yet.”

So, one week later we are left with more ideas as to what the “project” Way referred to in the post below could be, but few real answers as Way told a fan on Twitter “the project is still in sway.”

Here are a few more hints he dropped on Twitter:

@GiveEmHellCams I wish. The fate of the project is still in sway, so nothing to report yet. Killing me not to talk about it +share w/u guys — ジェラールド (@gerardway) August 4, 2013

@SoonAsIGetMyGun Possibly, that would be awesome — ジェラールド (@gerardway) August 4, 2013

@stumpys_fedora kind of mixes a bunch of things, so everything related — ジェラールド (@gerardway) August 4, 2013

As mentioned in the tweet above, five years ago would point to 2008, roughly the time when MCR's The Black Parade touring cycle ended. Way also released Dallas, the second series of his comic The Umbrella Academy late that year.

This morning, former My Chemical Romance vocalist Gerard Way teased on Twitter that he may be able to reveal some of the details of his next artistic step as early as next week.

I’m hoping next week I can tell you what I’m up to next, well, like part of it… — ジェラールド (@gerardway) July 27, 2013

Here's what he's hinted at already to tide you over:

-“What [he's] up to next” unlikely to be releated to comics. Way has noted several times recently that post-Killjoys he plans to step away from comics for a bit.

-Still, we can't guarantee that he's hinting at revealing music. Way has been known to dabble in many mediums, but if it is music…

-His new musical project is unlikely to be a solo venture. (“I feel that if I was going to do something like what they do, I’d have to be a lot older and I’d need a lot more life experience.”)

-He has described the project as being “connected deeply to what [he] was before [he] started My Chemical Romance”

–As sound goes: He has been working a lot with guitar and with the fuzz pedal-distorted sound in particular post-MCR. He first hinted at this in his Twitlonger post about MCR's break up, telling fans he still has the Fender Stratocaster he wrote their first song “Skylines And Turnstiles,” on, noting “He has a voice, and I would like to hear what it has to say.”

-“Zero Zero:” the song he posted on his personal SoundCloud, DannyTheStreet, last December:
