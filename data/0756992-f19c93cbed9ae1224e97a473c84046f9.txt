Wikipedia had to lock Trent Baalke's page because 49ers fans won't stop vandalizing it

Hopefully Trent Baalke doesn't google himself.

The general manager of the 49ers — and target of much fan vitriol after the team's 1-6 start — has had his Wikipedia page vandalized so many times over the past two days that Wikipedia put a temporary ban on edits.

The Mercury News noticed on Monday that someone had altered Baalke's page to read: "Despite the incredibly awful job he has done, and continued success in embarrassing and destroying this organization, gutless Jed York refuses to fire Baalke. An 11 year old can see that Baalke is running this team into the ground, but York doesn't care as long as he continues to make a profit."

But that was hardly the first or the last edit. The page's edit history shows dozens of changes since early October, including one that lists his position with the 49ers as "Professional Team Destroyer" and another as "Total Joke."

Another change, which survived several page edits, was the line, "If all goes well, he will be fired by the end of the 2016-2017 season." Someone else added that Baalke "continues to destroy the great franchise that was once an NFL powerhouse."

Years of poor drafts with Baalke at the helm have left the 49ers roster depleted. There's a clear need at quarterback that has gone unaddressed and, in 2016, Baalke failed to use any of his draft picks on an inside linebacker.

The 49ers currently have a bye week in which to stew over their problems and avoid Wikipedia.
