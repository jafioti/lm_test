The Virginia Board Of Elections certified State Sen. Mark Herring (D-Loudon) as the winner of the Virginia attorney general's race on Monday.

Herring defeated state Sen. Mark Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg) in the election, the closest statewide race in Virginia history. Herring had a 165-vote lead out of over 2.2 million votes cast.

On Monday morning, the Obenshain campaign told The Huffington Post he had not made a decision on whether or not to ask for a recount. Obenshain has 10 days under state law to request a recount, which the law allows the trailing candidate to do if the final margin of victory is less than one-half of 1 percent.

"Over the next few days, we will continue to review these results. Margins this small are why Virginia law provides a process for a recount. However, a decision to request a recount, even in this historically close election, is not one to be made lightly. Virginia law allows ten days to request a recount. We will make further announcements regarding a recount well within that time, in order to ensure the closure and confidence in the results that Virginians deserve," campaign manager Chris Leavitt said.
