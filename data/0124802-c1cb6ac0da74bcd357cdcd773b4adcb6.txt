CHICAGO â€” A trio of burglars forced their way into a Norwood Park home before driving away after residents confronted one of them during the Friday night incident, police said.

The incident occurred about 9:20 p.m. Friday in the 6400 block of North New England Avenue, according to a community alert.

At least one of the burglars forced their way into a home through the front door before multiple residents heard a loud noise and confronted one of them.

The burglars got away in a dark-colored SUV, possibly of a foreign make.

The suspects are described as men 20 to 35 years old, 5-foot-8 to 6 feet and 150 to 160 pounds. One is believed to be black, while the race of the other two men is unknown.
