Wallabies halfback Will Genia is comfortable with his decision to join the Melbourne Rebels on a two-year deal, but says the unfortunate timing of his return to Australian rugby spoiled his chance of a dream reunion with the Queensland Reds.

Genia has put pen to paper on a two-year deal with the Rebels despite declaring in June he would "probably just stay in Paris" if he could not return to the Reds.

The 78-Test veteran has committed to a deal with the Australian Rugby Union and Rebels that will see him through until 2019, having spent the past two years in Europe with Stade Francais.

Genia chalked up 114 matches for the Reds, including a Super Rugby title in 2011, and his intention was to return to Queensland to finish out his career.
