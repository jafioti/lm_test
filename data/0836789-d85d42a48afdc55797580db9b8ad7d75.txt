Apparently, giving someone a key to a city is something people still do. Evidently it doesn't just happen in sitcoms! The latest man to receive the honor is Michael Vick, who was given the key to Atlantic City by Mayor Lorenzo Langford.

"Michael Vick is caring and compassionate enough to reach out to our city when we were at our lowest point during the immediate aftermath of Super Storm Sandy," said Mayor Langford. "Twelve hours after a nationally televised Monday Night Football game, he was lifting the spirits of our residents confined to shelters with his generosity' particularly our young people. "And now, here he is again, helping us to spread the message that Atlantic City is open for business and ready for the summer season, all while continuing to encourage our youth to make positive contributions to the community."

Vick was in AC to help promote the "Restore the Shore" event which is designed to let tourists know that the Jersey shore is back in business after parts were devastated by superstorm Sandy last year.

I'm sure this news will be met with some manufactured controversy as all Michael Vick related news does... But honestly this seems like as good a reason as any to give away a symbolic award. Hopefully, at the very least it does help get the word out that the shore is indeed open for business once again.
