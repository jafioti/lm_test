Every New Year, employees of Bodybuilding.com pose two questions:

"What can we do better?"

"How do we improve our service to our customers?"

The answer doesn't always come from corner-office meetings or executive decrees. It often comes from the personal decision to make health and fitness a priority. Your health can't be our passion unless we're committed to our own.

The fire of our commitment to fitness gets stoked during the Employee Transformation Challenge. Every year for 12 weeks, we live the customer experience. We follow trainers, track everything on BodySpace, devour useful content, discover new products, and fight to live the fit lifestyle. We change our lives so we can help you change yours.

This year, 53 participants lost a combined total of 500 pounds! On average, each person lost 4.25 percent body fat. The supportive work culture and competitive nature of the of Bodybuilding.com team is a big reason so many members had such successful transformations. We are proud to call ourselves the fittest company in America!
