It's time to turn the page on the 2016 NFL offseason. In about a month teams will assemble for training camps and shortly after will begin competing in preseason contests. During that time, teams will trim their rosters from 90 players down to 53, while establishing starting lineups.

Some of the players selected to start around the league are sure to come as surprises.

Unexpected starters can come from almost anywhere. They can be mid- or late-round rookie draft picks, longtime backups or forgotten veterans. The one thing they have in common is they aren't currently considered front-runners for a starting job.

We're going to take a crack at identifying one surprise starter from each NFL team for the 2016 season. Our choices are based on factors like player potential, experience, level of competition and scheme fit.

There will be room for subjectivity here, and some surprises will undoubtedly be bigger than others.
