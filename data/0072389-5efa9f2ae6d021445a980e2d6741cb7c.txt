Generating leads is crucial to anyone who wants to develop a network marketing business successfully. Creating a lead lead means acquiring contact information of people by giving them the chance to express their interest in what you have to offer. Such leads are “opt-in” leads and you can market to them without being accused of spamming. It is a top most necessity in the industry.

When you look up and down the internet you will find tons of offers for so-called “opt-in leads”, however, when you consider what was said above you can see at once that such leads are scams

they have not opted in to your personal offer accordingly

they are no “opt-in” leads for you. If you want to do business properly you also have to make sure that such opt-in leads have the option of opting out of your information if they find it isn’t what they were looking for after all. There are millions of people out there who may not even know about your offer, but who would be interesting in it. Unless you consider generating leads as part of your marketing strategy, you are not likely to meet them on line. Sitting back in your chair doing nothing after you have created a web-site won’t get you anywhere!

It is a simple way of generating leads for network marketing or in fact any other business, to set up a subscription service to every advertisement or site you create. Also add a mailing list to your website. People who subscribe inform you that they are interested in your information, products and services. People who sign up for your mailing list express their interest in your offer. Now all you have to do is contact these leads and present your offer to them or find out which kind of information they were looking for. Chances are, that they will be happy to be in touch with you and eventually even work with you.
