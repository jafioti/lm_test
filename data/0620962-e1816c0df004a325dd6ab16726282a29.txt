I wish I could draw as well as him... that's for sure... lol

Well... in my opinion anyway lol

This was SUPER FUN to wood burn! And I think it turned out incredibly well!!! My best friend's birthday is today so I'm uploading this now so I can share it with everyone. She will be receiving it later today. She's like obsessed with the Cheshire Cat.* She absolutely loved it! Got the biggest hug ever XDI did not draw the original image! I used the following image by: 365-DaysOfDoodles Image: 365-daysofdoodles.deviantart.câ€¦ His work is like perfect for wood burning so I MAY do other pieces by him (OBVIOUSLY ONLY FOR EITHER MYSELF OR GIFTS).But yeah! Enjoy: Basswood: 8" x 11": 8.5 hoursI can't help just loving this piece! It looks sooooo good
