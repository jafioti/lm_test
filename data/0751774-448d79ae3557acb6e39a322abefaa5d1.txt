Infamous Renaissance woman subject of mystery portrait

Updated

A painting bought by the National Gallery of Victoria in 1965 has been a mystery - until today.

It has been revealed it is the work of famed Renaissance painter Dosso Dossi.

Furthermore, the subject of the 16th century portrait - long thought to be a boy - is actually Lucrezia Borgia, one of the most infamous women of the Italian Renaissance.

She was the daughter of Rodrigo Borgia - the powerful Renaissance Valencian who later became Pope Alexander VI - and his mistress, Vanozza dei Cattanei.

The Borgia family came to epitomise ruthless politics and sexual corruption. Historical record portrays Borgia as a manipulative woman who participated in incest and sexual orgies with her father and brother.

NGV conservator Carl Villis says it has taken years of research to unravel the mystery.

"If it is accepted for what we believe it to be, then it will be highly-significant because it will be incredibly rare," he said.

"We believe this to be the only formal painted portrait of Lucrezia Borgia."

Gallery staff will not speculate on how much the painting could be worth.

"With the subject being identified as Lucrezia Borgia and, very likely, the only surviving painted portrait of Lucrezia Borgia that exists, I would have thought we're talking many, many millions," NGV director Gerard Vaughan said.

"But we're not interested here in that. We're interested in scholarship and cracking the code, so to speak.

"We've actually solved an amazing problem."
