Heavy Equipment Access Mats

When dealing with heavy equipment, it is vital to protect the ground that vehicles are passing over. By neglecting to use any form of access mats or construction mats you may find that your work site becomes a boggy mess. In the best case scenario, the issue can be resolved with costly landscaping; the worst case scenario is having an expensive piece of equipment become stuck and damaged costing more time and money trying to free it.

Many heavy equipment drivers will be very familiar with traditional wooden heavy duty matting, made from either solid hardwood or chipboard for lighter vehicles. These have some pretty serious downsides that can be costly in the long term. We go into more detail on the downsides to timber construction pads and roadways here: Click Here.
