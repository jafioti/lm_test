They say you learn something new everyday - so, here's your new bit of information for today: Arsene Wenger is the only football manager who has an asteroid named after him.

On March 29 1998, an asteroid was discovered by Ian P. Griffin who, it turns out, is a Gooner. And being a proud Gooner, he decided to name his discovery after his team's boss.

Want some more background Arsene Wenger asteroid information? Of course you do, here's Nasa's naming citation:

"Born in France, Arsène Wenger (b. 1949) has managed the Arsenal Football Club in England since 1996. He is the club's most successful manager in terms of trophies won. In 2004 he became the only manager in Premier League history to go through an entire season undefeated."

And of course, no Arsene Wenger asteroid would be complete without it's own parody Twitter account, would it?

So, there you have it. Arsene Wenger is truly spaced out…
