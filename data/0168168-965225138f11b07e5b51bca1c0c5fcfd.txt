App updates can either be a blessing or a curse. For developers, space for improvement never runs out meanwhile it can be pain for the users as they tend to get adjusted or find the new update way too complicated. But no matter what the update is, you’d want to update out of curiosity or just end up updating the app by accident. After you’ve updated the app, there’s no way to go back to older version through the Google Playstore. No need to panic or worry, as you can easily reverse what you’ve done by simply downloading the older versions from the Internet.



Before you begin, make sure to enable installation from unknown sources on your phone. Which can be done by navigating to settings > security. By enabling this, you’ll be allowed to install apps from outside the Google Playstore.

Scoll down till you find the version of the app you want to download.
