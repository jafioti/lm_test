Came out pretty well, in all honesty. If I were to rate them, from my favorite to least favorite, in terms of result, I'd say: Freddy > Bonnie > Chica. Don't worry, Prototype Foxy will be a thing soon enough, same with Withered BB (As the test panel teases).If too many people have difficulty reading the test panel, I'll put it in the description. I decided for the setting to be a storage warehouse, since I don't see any reason why Prototypes wouldn't be put there. It's also why I decided to have multiple props laying around, like the wooden pizzas and sun.Transparent Versions: sta.sh/219d8cz9s8su?edit=1 (NOTE: Chica may look bigger than the others, but she really isn't, since the other two are the same size, they just have a bunch of empty space around them.)
