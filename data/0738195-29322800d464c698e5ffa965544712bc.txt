Harington replaces Robert Pattinson in the film, which stars Dakota Fanning and Guy Pearce.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is joining Dakota Fanning and Guy Pearce in the upcoming thriller Brimstone.

Harington's character was recently killed off in the shocking season finale of Game of Thrones. In Brimstone, he will play an outlaw who has a crucial role in the tale of retribution, replacing Robert Pattinson, who was announced to be filling the role during the Berlin film festival and market.

Carice van Houten (Valkyrie, Game of Thrones) also is part of the cast of the movie by writer-director Martin Koolhoven, who was behind Dutch box-office hit Winter in Wartime.

Principal photography started recently.

The project from Dutch filmmaker Koolhoven has also added to its cast Paul Anderson (Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows), Jack Roth (The Great Train Robbery) and Carla Juri (Wetlands).

Fanning stars as Liz, a heroine on the run from her past and chased by the evil Preacher (Pearce). Mia Wasikowska was originally cast in Fanningâ€™s role.

Embankment is handling world sales on the title.
