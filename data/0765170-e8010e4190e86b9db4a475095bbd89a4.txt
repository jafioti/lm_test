Screenwriter Noh Hee Kyung has already finished the script for “It’s Okay, It’s Love“, which is rare for any drama production.

According to a representative of the currently-airing romance drama “It’s Okay, It’s Love,” the show’s writer Noh Hee Kyung has completed the script for all 16 episodes on July 29.

This is a very rare occasion, especially for a drama that has just aired its fourth episode. Korean dramas are notorious for scripts being completed right before the shooting, or even having incomplete scripts for the filming. For the writer to have the script done so early means more time can be spent on finessing the details of the drama.

The cast has already finished reading the script up to the 10th episode.

“It’s Okay, It’s Love” started out with strong ratings last week. It stars Jo In Sung and Gong Hyo Jin in the leading roles.
