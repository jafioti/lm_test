Somewhere between splitting out as a wide receiver on the third play from scrimmage for the AFC and the midpoint of the first quarter, Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt mangled a finger on his left hand.

In an interview with Michelle Tafoya during the first quarter of the Pro Bowl broadcast on NBC, Watt showed his injured left hand to the camera. Watt’s left pinky finger was bleeding profusely and had left stains all over his jersey. Watt told Tafoya he wasn’t sure how the injury happened.

Watt did make a point to send a message to commissioner Roger Goodell during the interview hoping he takes note that the players are playing harder this season.

Watt returned to the game on the AFC’s next defensive series.
