- As most travelers know flying is often times a long game of hurry up and wait.

“Air travel today should be a lot quicker a lot more efficient,”said the owner of the SimCenter Tampa Bay, Peter Repak, who is also a pilot.

Now the TSA is looking to tackle that with technology. It’s experimenting with finger-print scanners to identify passengers.

The voluntary pilot program is kicking off in Atlanta and Denver’s airports.

“As far as thumb prints that could work really well, retina scan could work really well, you could do it at check in on your phone first,” Repak said.

JetBlue and Delta are also interested in using the tough-to-crack bio-metrics going forward. They could one day replace paper boarding passes altogether.

“I think it can be done in so many ways were people don’t have to go thru hurdles,” he said. “We should keep up with technology that will speed up the process in every way.”

TSA is monitoring the program and may expand it depending on how successful it turns out to be.
