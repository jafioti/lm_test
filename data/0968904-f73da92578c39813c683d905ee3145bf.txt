My Santa's gift arrived today! It was a nice surprise to find this in my mailbox, and it helped pull me out of the funk that I've been in. :)

I apologize for the disastrously poor quality of my photos... I was too excited to hold the camera steady. :-p

Included in the package was a note from my Santa, wishing me a Merry Christmas and letting me know that there was another (handmade!) gift coming soon. I really love making gifts, too, so I am extremely excited to see what they made for me. Whatever it is, I'm so glad that they took the time to do this and I know I will love it! (I will update this post as soon as it arrives!)

Thank you so much, Santa! :) I love my gifts and I can't wait for part 2!

Merry Christmas! :D

UPDATE: I received my handmade part 2 the other day, a really sweet striped coin pouch! Thanks again, my Secret Santa! This was my first exchange and I'm very happy with my gifts. :'D
