College football continues to morph into its own type of game, distancing itself from the NFL thanks to its varied playing styles. Yet one place where the two continue to intersect is at the quarterback position.

Though more and more NFL teams are willing to dabble in some spread tendencies, by and large, that league remains rooted in what's most commonly known as "pro-style" offenses. And no player adheres more to this standard than a quarterback who focuses almost solely on throwing the ball.

The pro-style quarterback is slowly fading out in college, but it's far from extinct. Of the 15 QBs selected in last month's NFL draft, the top five were pro-style passers, and all but two were known primarily for their arms when in college.

Who are the best at dropping back and slinging it in college in 2016? Check out our list of the best pro-style passers based on what they've done to this point and what's expected from them this season.
