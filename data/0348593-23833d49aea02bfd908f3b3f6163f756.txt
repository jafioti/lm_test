Along with the final approval of Volkswagen’s TDI settlement this morning, a schedule for when so called fixes will be proposed was also made public this morning. Proposals for the fixes will go by generation, and are expected to start on November 11 with the final deadline for the final fix coming on October 30 2017.

Volkswagen will propose a fix for “Generation 1” cars on November 11. That includes the Volkswagen Jetta (Model Years 2009-2014), Jetta SportWagen (2009-2014), Golf (2010-2014), Beetle (2013-2014), Beetle Convertible (2013-2014), and the Audi A3 (2010-2013).

The fix, according to court documents, will not have to return TDI emissions to certified standards. Instead, VW only has to get the implicated TDIs to be 80 to 90 pecent better than they are.

“Given the need to expeditiously address excess NOx emissions, the Court is satisfied this is a fair concession,” says the document, which also indicates that avoiding the junk yard is preferable to minor NOx emissions.

Although a proposal for the Generation 1 fix is expected in November, Volkswagen will have until January 27, 2017 to submit its proposal. The California Air Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency will then try to approve or deny the fix after 45 days.

Until then, and indeed for a time after, TDI owners aren’t required to make a decision about whether or not they want to take the fix or sell their car back to VW.

If the fix is approved, VW will first be required to remove the cheat device, then clearly indicate that the fix has been made and the corrected fuel economy ratings. Finally, an extended warranty will also be offered that covers the new parts.

VW is also required to offer the fix indefinitely and to anyone who has an affected TDI, regardless of their participation in the settlement program.

For generation 2 VWs—Passat (Model Year 2012-2014)—a proposal is expected on December 16, 2016 with the final deadline coming on March 3, 2017.

For generation 3, meanwhile—Jetta, Golf, Golf SportWagen, Beetle, Beetle Convertible, Passat and Audi A3 (Model Year 2015)—Volkswagen will have until October 30, 2017 to submit the final part of their proposal.
