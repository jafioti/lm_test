1 Martin Skrtel

Rafael Benitez will renew his attempt to sign Martin Skrtel from Liverpool this winter.

The Napoli manager signed the centre-back from Zenit in 2008 and is a big fan of his former player.

Benitez, who took Pepe Reina from the Reds on a season-long loan deal this summer, will be backed by his new club in the transfer market and his priority is signing a defender.

He tried to land Skrtel along with Reina in the summer but could not reach a deal – although Liverpool could be open to selling in January.

Brendan Rodgers has a wealth of options in defence, with the likes of Tiago Ilori and Mamadou Sakho joining on deadline day.

Rodgers also signed Kolo Toure on a free and Skrtel’s future at Anfield is unclear.

Benitez believes the chance to be reunited with his former charge will appeal to the Slovakian – although Liverpool will want over £10m for the player whose contract expires in 2016.
