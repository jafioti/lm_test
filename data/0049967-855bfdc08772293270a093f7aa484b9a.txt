"Everything is a suggestion, no matter what you say, it's a suggestion." Trump: Everything I say now is a suggestion

"Yeah. It was a suggestion. Look, anything I say right now, I'm not the president," Trump said. "Everything is a suggestion, no matter what you say, it's a suggestion."

"I feel strongly we have to do something about when you look at radical Islamic terrorism, we have a president that as you folks know very well, we have a president who won't use the term for the World Trade Center, he won't use the term. And we have to do something. And you're not going to do something about it until you know what the problem is," Trump said.

Trump also said he has spoken with Rudy Giuliani about heading a commission looking at immigration problems in the U.S.

"I have spoken to Rudy Giuliani. We're going to put together a group," he said. "We're going to look at the problem. We're going to study the problem. It's a temporary ban. I feel very strongly that we have to find out what the problem is. When you look at San Bernardino, when you look at Paris, when you look at all of these horrible, horrible acts of hatred, this is pure hatred. We have to find out and get to the bottom of the problem before we can solve it."
