Resolved Question: Did i turn my boyfriend into a vampire?



Ok so i have a new boyfriend "yay" and we have been seeing each other for about a month now :P



anyway, the other night we had a twilight marathon (i LOVE twilight) and a dream of mine is to have a vampire boyfriend!



I've been experimenting with eating my own blood ever since the twilight books first came out- i consider myself to be a vampire now- i usually just save the blood i lose naturally each month (i usually just keep the tampons in the freezer etc.) and suck on them or eat them later.



I decided that i would try and "turn" my new boyfriend. So i've been cooking my blood into his food when he comes over- i have tried making blood pudding as well, but that only works if i've had a heavy flow (you need A LOT of blood)- so i usually just add a little bit of blood into the marinade or pasta sauce etc. etc. He has absolutely no idea :P



i've been doing this for about 3-4 weeks- do you think he would be a vampire by now?
