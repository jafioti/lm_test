Natsume has announced Harvest Moon: Light of Hope will soon sprout on Nintendo Switch, as the company continues to celebrate 20 years since Harvest Moon first saw release on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

The game promises to encompass twenty years of spirit that has made the series what it is today and will be playable at E3 2017 next month.

In Harvest Moon: Light of Hope, players will look for a fresh start and new surroundings. When your ship is capsized after it is hit by a monsoon, you will drift into a small harbour town that has been ravaged by the storm.

It’s down to you to help rebuild the town and save the lighthouse, growing crops, tending livestock and gathering materials for repairs, all the while making new friends and starting a family.

“Harvest Moon: Light of Hope will set itself apart from other Harvest Moon titles with its depth, including a robust story and clear-cut goals,” shares Natsume president and CEO Hiro Maekawa.

“We set out to create a SNES-style nostalgic game with deep and meaningful characters and events, and we are excited to have our fans play it at E3 and tell us what they think!”
